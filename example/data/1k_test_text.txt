rotational atherectomy is performed with a rapidly rotating olive-shaped burr whose leading hemisphere is coated with microscopic diamond chips. contact of the burr with fibrocalcific plaque grinds calcified atheroma into particles small enough to pass through the distal myocardial capillary bed. it was designed to both "debulk a lesion" and to remove calcified tissue that after might interfere with the ability of a percutaneous balloon to pass.the routine use of rotational atherectomy during percutaneous coronary intervention (pci) was shown to not be useful in a meta-analysis of 16 device trials [1]. using data from the four trials that evaluated rotational atherectomy, its routine use, compared to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (ptca) alone, was associated with significant increases in restenosis (odds ratio [or] 1.25), myocardial infarction at 30 days (or 2.18), and major adverse cardiac events at one year (or 1.52).calcified and complex lesions — despite these shortcomings, rotational atherectomy is valuable for heavily calcified lesions that cannot be treated successfully by balloon angioplasty or that interfere with a delivery of a stent to a more distal location. it is also used commonly for calcified ostial lesions of the right coronary artery [3]. uncontrolled results from a multicenter registry found that rotational atherectomy was successful (defined as less than 50 percent residual stenosis) in 94 percent of calcific lesions [4]. (see "percutaneous coronary intervention of specific coronary lesions", section on 'ostial lesions'.)use prior to stenting — there is no value in performing rotational atherectomy routinely before stenting. the rotaxus trial randomized 240 patients with complex calcified native coronary lesions to stenting using a paclitaxel-eluting stent with or without routine rotational atherectomy. at nine months, clinical outcomes of mace, tlr, and definite stent thrombosis were not different [5]. however, rotational atherectomy does have utility prior to stenting when a proximal calcified segment prevents stent delivery or when there is a large plaque burden, which may interfere with optimal stent expansion and may be associated with an increased risk of in-stent restenosis.  internal mammary artery graft stenosis — although uncommon, stenosis within an internal mammary artery graft may cause recurrent ischemia after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (cabg). while such lesions are most often treated with balloon angioplasty, unsatisfactory results may occur when the lesion at the anastomotic site is rigid and fibrotic. although data are limited to a small number of patients, rotational atherectomy may infrequently be needed for such lesions [6]. (see "coronary artery bypass graft surgery: graft choices", section on 'arterial grafts'.)saphenous vein graft lesions — because of the increased risk for distal embolization, we generally limit use of rotational atherectomy in saphenous vein grafts to special circumstances. (see "coronary artery bypass graft surgery: prevention and management of vein graft stenosis".)use in diabetic patients — diabetics who undergo rotational atherectomy for diffuse coronary disease have a higher rate of angiographic restenosis at six months (72 versus 45 percent for patients without diabetes) and a higher rate of target lesion revascularization (67 versus 36 percent) [7]. (see "coronary artery revascularization in patients with diabetes mellitus and multivessel coronary artery disease".)in-stent restenosis — rotational atherectomy has been used to treat diffuse in-stent restenosis, particularly when there is significant hyperplasia inside the stent [8,9]. it leads to acute lumen gain by removing plaque and intimal hyperplasia, while adjunctive ptca produces additional lumen gain by further stent expansion and tissue extrusion [10]. despite success reported from a retrospective, observational study [8], a later randomized trial of 298 patients showed higher risk for recurrent restenosis [11].we do not generally use rotational atherectomy for treatment of in-stent restenosis.complications — potential complications of rotational atherectomy include severe coronary spasm, dissection, perforation, and slow flow through the capillary bed due to excessive particle embolization. this issue is discussed separately.adjunctive glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitor therapy with abciximab — distal particulate embolization may combine with platelet activation and aggregation to worsen coronary artery hypoperfusion and precipitate non-st elevation myocardial infarction. this mechanism is supported by a trial in which 100 patients were randomly assigned to abciximab or placebo during atherectomy [12]. patients treated with abciximab were less likely to have elevated levels of ck-mb (8 versus 22 percent for placebo), slow-flow, or postprocedural chest pain.further support for efficacy of abciximab comes from an observational study of 75 patients who underwent radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging prior to, during, and two days after atherectomy [13]. the 30 patients who received abciximab during the procedure had a significantly lower rate of transient perfusion defects (33 versus 87 percent).use of glycoprotein iib/iiia inhibitors has declined overall, but some of our experts do use them occasionally on a case-by-case basis. tirofiban and eptifibatide are acceptable; abciximab is no longer marketed in the united states, canada, and most european countries.rotational atherectomy summary — the american college of cardiology/american heart association/society for cardiovascular angiography and interventions (acc/aha/scai) guideline update for pci concluded that there is no evidence that rotational atherectomy improves late outcomes in lesions that can be safely treated with stenting or angioplasty alone [14,15]. when rotational atherectomy is being considered, the weight of evidence or opinion was in favor of the efficacy of ivus for establishing the presence and distribution of coronary calcium. however, in our practices, ivus is rarely used for this indication.orbital atherectomy

charcot-marie-tooth (cmt) disease is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail elsewhere. (see "charcot-marie-tooth disease: genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis".)cmt is really a spectrum of disorders caused by specific mutations in genes that are typically expressed in myelin and/or axons. the clinical expression of these conditions is often affected by "gene dosage imbalance" caused by dna duplications or deletions, as is the case in the most common form of cmt (ie, cmt1a caused by pmp22 gene duplications). the association of different mutations within the same gene with various clinical phenotypes is a common finding in the hmsn/cmt group of peripheral neuropathies. this variability suggests that these disorders represent a spectrum of related phenotypes caused by an underlying defect in peripheral nervous system myelination and/or axonal function.cmt has been classified as types 1 through 7 and consists of at least 30 different disorders. the majority of cases fall within type 1 (autosomal dominant inheritance, demyelinating physiology) and type 2 (autosomal dominant inheritance, axonal physiology), with an estimated prevalence of 40 per 100,000. common features include both motor and sensory nerve manifestations with distal leg weakness, foot deformities (pes cavus, hammer toes), and sensory deficits (table 1).a unique feature observed in some patients with x-linked cmt type 1 (cmtx1) involves transient episodes of dysarthria, ataxia, hemiparesis, or tetraparesis, associated with similarly transient white matter lesions in the brain. (see "charcot-marie-tooth disease: genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'cmtx1'.)hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy — hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy (hnpp, tomaculous neuropathy) is a recurrent, episodic demyelinating neuropathy (table 2) associated with pmp22 deletions and point mutations that is allelic to charcot-marie-tooth disease type 1a (cmt1a). (see "charcot-marie-tooth disease: genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy'.)affected patients typically present with isolated nerve palsies with localization in areas frequently affected by compression or trauma. the most frequently affected nerves include the axillary, median, radial, ulnar, peroneal, or brachial plexus nerves. other findings include cranial nerve involvement, nerve deafness, and scoliosis.symptoms first appear in the second decade in most patients, but they can occur in younger children or be delayed until into the third decade. single nerve palsies typically appear sequentially, resolving in days to months, and may be associated with persistent motor deficits in the same or in another distribution.hnpp is an autosomal dominant disorder. in approximately 80 percent of hnpp cases, there is a 1.5 mb deletion in chromosome 17p11.2 that results in reduced expression of the pmp22 gene. the deletion corresponds to the duplicated region of pmp22 present in cmt1a (see "charcot-marie-tooth disease: genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis", section on 'cmt1a'). approximately 20 percent of patients with hnpp have point mutations or small deletions in the pmp22 gene, and sporadic cases with de novo deletions have been described.hereditary brachial plexopathy

similar results were provided by another randomized trial including 70 children of 6 to 12 years of age with atopic dermatitis who received oral melatonin 6 mg or placebo an hour before bedtime for six weeks, while continuing their usual treatment with topical corticosteroids and emollients [157]. at the end of the study, children in the melatonin supplementation group compared with those in the placebo group had a greater improvement in the total scorad score from baseline (-6.6 versus -2.6 points) and in the total children's sleep habits questionnaire (cshq) score (-5.5 versus -2.7 points), but not in the pruritus score. a decrease in the total immunoglobulin e (ige) level and an increase in the total sleep time per night were also noted in the melatonin group but not in the placebo group. no adverse effects associated with treatment were reported.larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to establish the role and safety of long-term melatonin supplementation in the management of atopic dermatitis in children and adolescent.chinese herbal medicine — chinese herbal medications for atopic dermatitis have been used for many years, but their efficacy and safety have not been adequately evaluated in clinical trials [158,159]. a systematic review found three small randomized trials and one open-label trial of a commercial preparation of 10 traditional chinese herbs (zemaphyte, no longer available) [160]. two trials showed a reduction in erythema and skin surface damage and improvement in sleep in the active treatment group, but not in the placebo group. another trial did not find any significant difference between the active treatment and placebo. however, all studies were small (less than 50 patients) and had methodologic flaws. (see "chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of allergic diseases", section on 'therapy for atopic dermatitis'.)leukotriene receptor antagonists — montelukast, an oral leukotriene receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis in children and adults, has been evaluated for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in a few randomized trials with conflicting results.a systematic review of five randomized trials including 202 adults and children older than six years with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis evaluated the efficacy of oral montelukast (10 mg/day in adults and 5 mg/day in children aged 6 to 14 years) given for four to eight weeks, compared with placebo (three studies) or conventional treatment with oral antihistamines and topical corticosteroids (two studies) [161]. the main outcome measure was a reduction in disease severity assessed by using validated score systems (ie, scorad; eczema area and severity index [easi]; six area, six sign atopic dermatitis [sassad]). the pooled analysis of three studies did not show a difference between montelukast and placebo in improving disease severity (standardized mean difference 0.29, 95% ci -0.23 to 0.81) and pruritus and in reducing the need for topical corticosteroids. in the two studies comparing montelukast with conventional treatment, participants using montelukast experienced improvement in disease severity in one study but no effect in the other study [162,163]. all trials were of low quality with a significant risk of bias.because of the limited and low-quality available evidence, the role of leukotriene receptor antagonists in the management of atopic dermatitis remains uncertain. while waiting for larger and well-designed studies, we do not support the use of this class of agents for adults or children with atopic dermatitis.referral

the victim has reported homicidal or suicidal ideation or other emergency complaints.in all other cases, an evaluation by an experienced child abuse team, if available, and in a nonemergency setting should be scheduled as soon as possible after the alleged incident or disclosure [3,24]. in addition to an evaluation for sexual abuse, it is essential that each child receives a thorough general medical assessment that may identify unmet medical and psychological needs [22].history — obtaining an unbiased history from a child who may have been sexually abused may be the most important part of the evaluation, particularly since diagnostic physical findings are frequently absent [5,13,20,25]. a history of sexual abuse that is obtained in the course of medical diagnosis and treatment may be admissible in court as an exception to the laws restricting hearsay testimony. thus, complete (verbatim, if possible) documentation of questions and answers is critical [15,26]. (see "child abuse: social and medicolegal issues".)on the other hand, in the evaluation of nonspecific complaints that are possibly related to sexual abuse, the history should focus on differentiating among possible explanations for the child's symptoms: sexual abuse, physical abuse to the genital area, unintentional injury to the genital area, or other medical conditions [3,27]. (see 'differential diagnosis' below.)caregiver history — the history regarding concerns about sexual abuse and any accompanying symptoms should be obtained from the parent or caregiver separately from the child in a calm, unhurried manner. many parents are understandably worried and appreciate an opportunity to share their concerns privately.the history should be comprehensive and include the child's current and past medical problems as well as social and family histories [13]. the review of systems should identify changes in bowel or bladder habits (such as enuresis or encopresis), sleep disturbances, and behavioral changes and when they were first noted. sexual abuse often triggers these symptoms.parents should be asked how the abuse came to light or, if the child has not disclosed abuse, why the parents suspect it [28]. for children who have made a disclosure, the content of statements to parents or other caregivers should be documented.patient interview — since the history from the child is such an important part of the evaluation, it should be performed by an experienced professional. for patients who have disclosed sexual abuse, the history obtained by the evaluating physician may be abbreviated [13]. investigative interviews should be performed by the appropriate agencies, and if possible, by forensic interviewers [5,15]. this minimizes the need for a child to relate painful and distressing information on multiple occasions and also reduces bias that may be introduced by repeated, suggestive, or leading questions.in cases where sexual abuse is suspected but not yet disclosed, the evaluating physician must obtain additional information from the caregiver. child protective services (cps) should intervene to determine the need for a trained forensic interviewer when there is reasonable concern that abuse has occurred.during the evaluation of child sexual abuse cases, the role of each clinician should be clearly defined and based on clinical expertise. as an example, a clinical assistant who is handling laboratory specimens should not ask the child or family about the details of the abuse. in the situation where the clinician must obtain a history of abuse from the child, he or she must remember that this should be an opportunity for the patient to tell the story without guidance or prompting from the parent or examiner.the following section outlines a common approach taken by trained interviewers when questioning a child or adolescent who has been sexually abused.●

clinically important adverse events are uncommon with regadenoson. the most common side effects for regadenoson are shortness of breath, headache, and flushing; however, as compared with adenosine, a tolerability comparison between the two agents showed lower overall symptoms with regadenoson when compared with adenosine [34].in general, both dipyridamole and adenosine, when combined with spect mpi, have a comparable sensitivity and specificity of 80 to 90 percent for detection of significant obstructive chd [41,42]. regadenoson has been shown to provide diagnostic information comparable to a standard adenosine infusion [29,31].combined exercise and vasodilator stress — the combination of low-level treadmill exercise during vasodilator stress test is safe, effective, and yields important clinical information [43-46]. this combined approach has the advantages of reducing noncardiac side effects associated with vasodilator stress (table 2) and improving image quality by decreasing liver and gut activity with spect mpi and providing prognostic information [47-50]. adding exercise to the vasodilator does not further increase coronary blood flow [51-53], but it does provide a better assessment of exercise capacity and may provide additional clinical information from the exercise ecg test [47]. this approach may make nondiagnostic tests less likely in patients with limited exercise capacity compared with exercise alone.the potential benefits of combined testing were illustrated in a study in which 407 patients were randomly assigned to six minutes of adenosine infusion alone, six minutes of adenosine with submaximal exercise, or symptom-limited exercise with continuous adenosine [48]. the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of coronary disease or of stenosis in individual coronary arteries were similar in the three groups; however, the combined protocols were associated with a 43 percent reduction in noncardiac side effects related to vasodilation and a 90 percent reduction in major arrhythmias compared with adenosine infusion alone.example protocols for the addition of exercise to vasodilator stress rmpi:●

the revised classification system for dystonia (table 1) is based upon clinical characteristics (axis 1) and etiology (axis 2).the clinical features important for the classification of dystonia are age of onset, body distribution, temporal pattern, and associated features (table 1). early-onset (ie, age ≤21 years) dystonia most often begins with symptoms in the limbs, typically the leg, and spreads to other body areas to become generalized in over 50 percent of patients [2]. by contrast, late-onset (ie, age >21 years) dystonia most frequently begins in the neck, arm, or face and tends to remain focal or segmental. (see 'early-onset isolated dystonia' below and 'adult-onset focal or segmental isolated dystonia' below.)several presentations of dystonia (eg, a child with onset in the neck or face, or an adult with onset in the leg, or an adult who develops generalized dystonia) are not characteristic of isolated dystonia or the most common genetically determined form (dyt-tor1a) of dystonia; they indicate the need to evaluate for an underlying cause. (see 'diagnosis' below.)isolated torsion dystonia (previously known as primary dystonia, primary torsion dystonia, dystonia musculorum deformans, and oppenheim dystonia) presents with signs related solely to dystonia and may have associated tremor but lacks additional neurologic, laboratory, or imaging abnormalities. the onset and progression of symptoms is gradual and usually without fixed postures. however, contractures may sometimes develop in areas chronically affected by dystonia, particularly if the dystonia is present at rest as well as with action. isolated torsion dystonia may be sporadic or inherited. most early-onset isolated torsion dystonia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with a reduced penetrance of 30 percent.the etiologic categories for the classification of dystonia (table 1) are the presence or absence of nervous system pathology and the distinction among inherited (table 2), acquired (table 3), and idiopathic forms. inherited dystonias are those with proven genetic origin [1]. since the discovery of dyt-tor1a, the first gene mutation to be cloned, many additional genetic forms of dystonia have been described [3-7]. in the older system, chronologically assigned, consecutively numbered locus symbols (dyt1 to dyt23) were used to represent the expanding list of hereditary dystonias (table 4). however, this system proved unsatisfactory for many reasons, including symbols of questionable significance, known pathogenic mutations whose genes did not have dyt symbols, and assignment of syndromes with prominent dystonia to loci suggesting other movement disorders (eg, park13) or assignment of other movement disorders to loci suggesting dystonia (eg, dyt3) [3,5,7]. the newer but still evolving method (table 2) uses the molecular genetic abnormality (if known) in place of a numeral (eg, dyt-tor1a rather than dyt1) with the goal of providing more informative symbols that include only confirmed disease-causing mutations."secondary dystonia" is the term previously used for dystonia with a known acquired cause (table 3), or for dystonia with additional neurologic signs (now referred to as combined dystonia) such as muscle weakness, spasticity, ataxia, ocular motility abnormalities, retinal abnormalities, cognitive impairment, or seizures. acquired dystonia usually arises from a specific underlying condition (table 3), such as perinatal brain injury or exposure to dopamine receptor-blocking drugs (eg, tardive dystonia). antibody-mediated syndromes, such as anti-n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor encephalitis, can manifest with dystonia and other abnormal movements, usually in combination with cognitive or behavioral symptoms [8]. the presence of other neurologic abnormalities may provide the clue to the cause of the dystonia [9]. brain magnetic resonance imaging (mri) findings vary with the etiology.pathogenesis

osteoporosis is a common disease that is characterized by low bone mass with microarchitectural disruption and skeletal fragility, resulting in an increased risk of fracture, particularly at the spine, hip, wrist, humerus, and pelvis [1]. it is difficult to diagnose osteoporosis in the setting of chronic kidney disease (ckd). this is particularly relevant for the aging population, where fragility fractures, reduced glomerular filtration rate (gfr), and low bone mineral density (bmd) are more prevalent. there are multiple reasons why this differentiation is important, not the least of which is that management of osteoporosis differs vastly from treatment of other bone diseases in patients with ckd.this topic will review the diagnosis and evaluation of osteoporosis in patients with ckd. the management of osteoporosis in ckd, as well as the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of other aspects or mineral and bone disorders (mbd) in patients with ckd are reviewed elsewhere.●

palliative embolization of bone metastases – palliative embolization may reduce symptoms or be used prior to surgery.surgery may be considered for patients with single distant metastases, including patients with a single bone metastasis [57], brain metastases [58], or limited pulmonary metastases [59]. the five-year survival for 31 patients with papillary cancer after thoracic metastasectomy was 64 percent [59], and radical surgical extirpation of isolated bone metastases is associated with improved survival [60].pamidronate may reduce bone pain from skeletal metastases and improve quality of life, and in one study, resulted in partial radiologic improvement in 2 of 10 patients [61]. zoledronic acid can also be used, although its greater potency may increase risk of hypocalcemia and osteonecrosis of the jaw (onj) (although this remains a rare complication) [62,63]. (see "risks of therapy with bone antiresorptive agents in patients with advanced malignancy", section on 'osteonecrosis of the jaw'.)denosumab (a receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-b [rank] ligand inhibitor) is also available for the prevention of skeletal related events (pathologic fracture, need for surgery or external beam irradiation to a bone metastasis, or spinal cord compression) in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. thus, denosumab is an alternative to bisphosphonate therapy in the management of thyroid cancer patients with bone metastases [64]. (see "osteoclast inhibitors for patients with bone metastases from breast, prostate, and other solid tumors", section on 'denosumab'.)systemic chemotherapy or palliative external radiotherapy may be considered for patients with either local or distant recurrence or when radioiodine fails to control local growth and spread of disease. (see "differentiated thyroid cancer refractory to standard treatment: chemotherapy" and "differentiated thyroid cancer: external beam radiotherapy".)high serum thyroglobulin and negative radioiodine scan — it is not uncommon to identify patients who have abnormal serum tg values after total thyroidectomy and radioiodine ablation with no evidence of radioiodine avidity on diagnostic and, often, post-therapy radioiodine scans [65,66]. these false-negative scans may reflect inadequate tsh stimulation, iodine contamination, the presence of tumor deposits too small to be detected by a scintillation camera, or loss of iodine uptake through tumor dedifferentiation.the management of such patients is controversial, and there are insufficient data to determine optimal therapy [67].our approach to patients with radioiodine-negative, serum tg-positive disease is as follows:●

while managing the patient with significant hypothermia, keep in mind that the hypothermic heart is very sensitive to movement. rough handling of the patient may precipitate arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation. take care to avoid jostling the patient during the physical examination or the performance of essential procedures.airway, breathing, circulation — the management of hypothermia requires evaluation and support of the airway, breathing, and circulation; prevention of further heat loss; initiation of rewarming appropriate to the degree of hypothermia; and treatment of complications [13,30,46]. a table outlining the emergency management of hypothermia in adults is provided (table 1). (see "advanced cardiac life support (acls) in adults" and "rapid sequence intubation for adults outside the operating room".)endotracheal intubation is performed in patients with respiratory distress or who cannot protect their airway. early intubation can facilitate clearance of secretions produced by cold-induced bronchorrhea in patients with altered mental status or a decreased cough reflex. standard medications can be used to perform rapid sequence intubation, if necessary; atropine is not indicated as a pretreatment agent to reduce bronchorrhea.in the field and in the emergency department, misdiagnosis of a non-perfusing rhythm, even with a cardiac monitor, is a hazard. peripheral pulses can be difficult to palpate in a vasoconstricted bradycardic patient. it is best to check for a central pulse for up to a full minute, using a continuous wave doppler, if available. alternatively, a focused bedside echocardiogram can be performed.cardiopulmonary resuscitation (cpr), including chest compressions, should be initiated in patients with accidental hypothermia who sustain a cardiac arrest. contraindications to chest compressions include: verified dnr ("do not resuscitate") status, obviously lethal injuries, a frozen chest wall that is not compressible, and the presence of any signs of life. always assume that some perfusion is occurring when any sign of life is present. although evidence is scant, we believe that chest compressions should not be performed in patients who manifest an organized rhythm on a cardiac monitor even if they have no palpable pulses and no other signs of life. our reasoning is that such rhythms may reflect successful perfusion that could be disrupted by chest compressions, and that any pulseless electrical activity (pea) is likely to be transient. there is little downside to withholding cpr briefly in these hypothermic patients. should pea become asystole, chest compressions should be started immediately. chest compressions should also not be started if cardiac contractions are seen on bedside echocardiogram or pulses can be detected with doppler ultrasound.if pulses are not found after checking for one minute, cpr should be started immediately and provided continuously if possible. continuous cpr may not be possible due to safety considerations or during evacuation of the patient. mechanical chest-compression devices should be used, if available, to avoid interruption of cpr during transport. cpr can be delayed up to 10 minutes while rescuers move the patient to a safer location. in a patient with core temperature of 20 to 28°c, or if the core temperature is not known, administer cpr continuously for periods of at least 5 minutes, alternating with periods of no longer than 5 minutes without cpr. in patients with a core temperature below 20°c, administer cpr continuously for periods of at least 5 minutes, alternating with periods of no longer than 10 minutes without cpr [10,47]. (see "therapies of uncertain benefit in basic and advanced cardiac life support", section on 'automatic compression devices'.)patients with moderate or severe hypothermia frequently become disproportionately hypotensive during rewarming from severe dehydration and fluid shifts [9,19,21]. two large (14 or 16 gauge) peripheral ivs should be placed. blood pressure is supported with warmed (40 to 42°c) infusions of isotonic crystalloid. large infusions may be necessary. use of warmed crystalloid is critical. infusion of room-temperature fluids can worsen hypothermia. intraosseous (io) access may be easier to obtain than intravenous access in cold, vasoconstricted patients. io lines should be primed with a 10 ml bolus of isotonic crystalloid with or without lidocaine immediately after insertion to open the marrow space and to help ensure good flow.a central venous catheter may aid with fluid resuscitation. temporary placement of a femoral venous catheter is preferred to avoid precipitating an arrhythmia from irritation of the right atrium. low-dose (2 to 5 mcg/min) dopamine can be used to maintain blood pressure in cases refractory to volume resuscitation. other vasopressors are acceptable, but studies to support their use have not been performed [48,49]. an indwelling bladder catheter is helpful to assess urinary output and fluid shifts.core temperature, ideally esophageal temperature in intubated patients, should be monitored closely to assess the adequacy of therapy and to prevent iatrogenic hyperthermia (see 'assessment' above). rough movement and activity must be avoided, as they may provoke ventricular fibrillation.duration of resuscitation — because of the neuroprotective effects of hypothermia, complete recovery of patients with hypothermia and cardiac arrest has been well documented despite prolonged resuscitation [22,50-53]. therefore, under usual circumstances, resuscitative efforts should only be withheld if there is a nonsurvivable injury or fatal illness, if the body is so frozen that chest compressions are impossible, or if the nose and mouth are blocked with snow or ice [10,54]. efforts should be continued (occasionally for several hours) until the patient's core temperature reaches 32 to 35°c (90 to 95°f) [19].a number of biochemical markers can help inform the decision whether to continue resuscitation [11,55,56]. extreme hyperkalemia reflects cell lysis and may predict a futile resuscitation. survival is rare when the serum potassium concentration exceeds 12 meq/l (mmol/l). case reports suggest that lower cutoffs (eg, 8 meq/l) should not be used [57]. evidence of intravascular thrombosis (eg, fibrinogen concentration below 50 mg/dl [1.5 mmol/l]), ammonia concentrations above 420 mcg/dl (250 mmol/l), and elevated blood lactate or serum sodium or creatinine are additional indicators of a poor prognosis [58].rewarming based on severity of hypothermia — individuals should be extracted from the hypothermic environment in the horizontal position whenever possible. even low intensity use of peripheral muscles should be avoided, as muscular perfusion and consequently core temperature afterdrop is accelerated by exertion [9].rewarming should begin as soon as possible. rewarming techniques are divided into passive external rewarming, active external rewarming, and active internal core rewarming. the degree of hypothermia determines the techniques implemented [22,59]:●

cardiomyopathyalthough insulin treatment and intensive prenatal and neonatal care have improved, neonatal complications and congenital anomalies observed in diabetic pregnancies contribute to a reported perinatal mortality rate that ranges from 0.6 to 4.8 percent.pregestational versus gestational diabetes — infants born to mothers with pregestational diabetes have a higher risk of mortality and morbidity compared with offspring from mothers with gestational dm; these infants are more likely to be macrosomic, preterm, and have congenital anomalies [14-17]. for infants born to mothers with gestational dm, the risk of adverse neonatal effects modestly increases when mothers require insulin treatment during pregnancy compared with infants whose mothers are managed by diet alone [18]. strict glycemic control preconception and during pregnancy is associated with lower perinatal mortality and morbidity. (see "diabetes mellitus in pregnancy: screening and diagnosis" and "gestational diabetes mellitus: glycemic control and maternal prognosis", section on 'rationale for treatment'.)infants of mothers who have insulin-treated dm are more likely to be preterm and macrosomic than infants born to mothers with type 2 dm not treated with insulin as well as infants of mothers with gestational diabetes. this was illustrated in a population study of all live births in finland between 2004 and 2014. infants of women with any type of dm who received insulin therapy were at highest risk for large for gestational age and preterm birth (40 and 37 percent, odds ratio [adjusted or] 43.8, 95% ci 40.88-46.93 and 11.17, 95% ci 10.46-11.93, respectively), infants of women with type 2 dm not receiving insulin were at mild to moderately increased risk (12.8 and 10.1 percent, aor 9.57, 95% ci 8.65-10.58 and 2.12, 95% ci 1.9-2.36, respectively), and infants of women with gestational dm not receiving insulin were mildly or no increased risk (5 and 5 percent, aor 3.8, 95% ci 3.66-3.96 and 1, respectively) compared with women with no diabetes (2 and 5 percent) [17]. these data can be useful for counseling women with diabetes about risks for lga and ptb in offspring. (see "pregestational diabetes: preconception counseling, evaluation, and management", section on 'fetal and neonatal risks' and "pregestational diabetes mellitus: obstetrical issues and management".)congenital anomalies — infants of mothers with diabetes are at significant risk for major congenital anomalies due to maternal hyperglycemia at the time of conception and during early gestation (table 1) [5]. the overall reported risk for major malformations is approximately 5 to 6 percent with a higher prevalence rate of 10 to 12 percent when mothers require insulin therapy [13,15,19]. in a study of 13,030 infants with congenital anomalies and 4895 without birth defects, when compared with a reference group of nondiabetic control mothers, the risk of isolated and multiple congenital anomalies was highest in infants of mothers with pregestational diabetes (adjusted odd ratios [or] 3.17, 95% ci 2.2-4.99 and adjusted or 8.62, 95% ci 5.27-14.1, respectively) followed by infants born to mothers with gestational diabetes (adjusted or 1.42, 95% ci 1.17-1.73 and adjusted or 1.5, 95% ci 1.13-2.0) [20].congenital malformations account for approximately 50 percent of the perinatal deaths in infants of mothers with diabetes [21]. this risk can be reduced by strict glycemic control during the pre- and periconceptual (first eight weeks of pregnancy) periods. two-thirds of the anomalies in infants of mothers with diabetes involve either the cardiovascular system (8.5 per 100 live births or central nervous system (cns) (5.3 per 100 live births) [19].●

a continuous spinal, the least common of the neuraxial techniques, may be performed after accidental dural puncture during a routine epidural procedure by threading the catheter directly into the intrathecal space. alternatively, smaller gauge needles and catheters are made for this purpose, but are not routinely used in the united states.epidural versus cse — the choice between conventional epidural and combined spinal-epidural (cse) techniques is often determined by the clinical situation, institutional norms, available equipment, and clinician preference.cse techniques may provide some benefits over traditional labor epidurals, including faster onset of analgesia (three to five minutes) [12] and lower need for rescue analgesia. in addition, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials reported a lower risk of unilateral block with cse, without a difference in the need for catheter replacement or unscheduled top-ups [8]. despite the dural puncture with the cse technique, the risk of post dural puncture headache (pdph) does not appear to be increased. cse technique has, however, been associated with a higher incidence of pruritus and fetal bradycardia than epidural labor analgesia [12].

the etiology of fmd remains unknown. although a variety of factors have been implicated, most investigators now believe that genetics play an important role in the development of fmd [1], with some studies reporting an autosomal mode of inheritance with variable penetrance [26,27]. another study found an association between fmd and a single nucleotide variant in the phosphatase and actin regulator 1 gene (phactr1) [28]. this variant, rs9349379, is also a risk locus for coronary artery disease, migraine headache, and cervical artery dissection [29].given the predominance in women of childbearing age, hormonal influences are thought to also be important in the pathogenesis of fmd, yet there are no definitive studies. it is also possible that mechanical factors such as stretching of smooth muscle cells and trauma to the blood vessel wall may initiate the changes seen in fmd, but this theory has never been proven.clinical manifestations

identification of patients whose disease has been at low risk for progression for an extended period is a critical issue in the choice of active surveillance for men with prostate cancer. we consider active surveillance to be an appropriate approach for very low-risk and low-risk prostate cancer (table 1). key criteria include clinically localized disease (≤t2a (table 2)), grade group 1 disease (table 3), and serum prostate-specific antigen (psa) ≤10 ng/ml. other factors include the absence of certain histologic features (areas of cribriform or intraductal cancer), low-risk gene expression profiles, and psychological comfort with active surveillance.consistent with guidelines from the national comprehensive cancer network (nccn) [1], we reserve genomic testing for men who have low-risk disease but have risk factors for more aggressive disease. these include a high psa density, a strong family history of aggressive prostate cancer, african american ethnicity, very extensive grade group 1 disease (table 3), or highly suspicious magnetic resonance imaging (mri) with a targeted biopsy showing no or only grade group 1 cancer. (see "molecular prognostic tests for prostate cancer".)active surveillance is also an option for men with favorable intermediate-risk disease, but patients should be informed that this comes with a higher risk of developing metastases compared with definitive treatment [5]. active surveillance is not indicated for men with unfavorable intermediate-risk disease.risk stratification and recommendations from expert groups — although definitive criteria for patient selection have not been established in formal clinical trials, large case series have been used to establish guidelines for treatment of men at low risk for disease progression. the use of active surveillance for men with localized, low-risk prostate cancer has been endorsed by key guideline-setting groups, albeit with slight differences in their recommendations:●

access to services – the availability and provision of individualized supports (eg, early intervention, educational, vocational, transition, and post-transition services) has a considerable impact on outcomes for individuals with id [37]. deinstitutionalization has improved the lives of many individuals with id; however, specialized support needs have shifted into community settings, which requires planning, financial provision, and comprehensive services. appropriate supports lessen the impact of disability and improve the functioning of individuals with id. for many children, developmental progress is manifested by stable, enduring gains in function, but for others, the improvements are contingent upon sustaining support [1]. for youth with id, factors that impact the success of transitioning into adulthood include access, availability, and the provision of needed interventions, the quality and extent of transition and post-school services, necessary expertise in care, residential options, occupational opportunities, transport, socioeconomic, and family factors [35]. transition of individuals with id is important to subsequent progress and long-term functioning. (see 'transition planning' above.)outcomes according to severity level — the level of severity in id markedly influences short and long-term outcomes. severity is defined by the level of support needed, rather than by iq scores (table 4) [1]. (see "intellectual disability in children: definition, diagnosis, and assessment of needs", section on 'classification of severity'.)mild id — most affected children and adolescents have mild id. children with mild id attain higher levels of skills and progress at a faster pace than children with more severe id. children with mild id can be anticipated to gain skills at approximately one-half to two-thirds of the rate of children without id. outcomes vary depending on coexisting conditions and the level of support provided. standardized test scores achieved by children with mild id tend to decrease over time, compared with typically developing children. however, some children with mild levels of global developmental delay (gdd) who receive appropriate early intervention may make sufficient progress by five years of age such that they may not meet criteria for id. in addition, some children with id can improve in their adaptive functioning with appropriate individualized intervention, and no longer meet adaptive impairment criteria required for an id diagnosis.most children with mild id need sustained academic supports to be able to learn and acquire age-typical conceptual skills, such as reading [1]. with appropriate supportive services, children with mild id usually accomplish reading at a third to sixth grade level by late adolescence [42]. however, some adults with mild id are functionally illiterate. individuals with mild id have difficulties grasping complex information. planning, problem solving, and money management need long-term support. greater gullibility, less mature judgment, and vulnerability to manipulation put children and adolescents with mild id at particular risk.children with mild id have better social skills, communication, and social judgment than children with more severe id and they usually can relate to others, communicate in friendship, and display social play and extracurricular interests. however, their interests and skill levels may be similar to those of younger children. social adaptive and communication outcomes vary depending on other coexisting conditions. children with autism have disproportionate impairment in social skills communication for their level of cognitive functioning.the long-term outcome of individuals with mild id is related to their combined cognitive and adaptive functioning. most individuals with mild id are able to accomplish independent daily living activities. many are able to live independently with provided supports, including decision-making for health, nutrition, finances, or raising a family. adults with mild id can marry and become a parents, although raising children is challenging.individuals with mild id have the greatest potential for vocational placement, provided they receive appropriate individualized services, and that other comorbidities aren't prohibitive. some affected adults can attain a simple regular position requiring straightforward occupational skills, or paid employment in a competitive workplace, given appropriate supports. however, adults with low levels of functional independence need sheltered employment and assisted living or a group home. in one report of long-term follow-up of 52 individuals with mild id followed from birth to adulthood, 73 percent were married, 67 percent had a job, 62 percent had children, and 54 percent owned their own home [43].moderate id — approximately 10 percent of individuals with id have been estimated to have moderate id. children with moderate id are able to slowly make progress in skill development and usually develop at approximately one-third to one-half the rate of children without id [42].school-based academic and social development gains are slow. conceptual skills lag well behind those of peers; substantial help or support is needed for conceptual tasks. academic skills in adults are typically at elementary level. children with moderate id learn to read essential words and signs such as "stop," "exit," or "danger." with educational services, a child with moderate id can learn to read at a first to third grade level.simple spoken language and social friendships are possible, but significantly limited by social and communication deficits. social cues, social judgment, and social decisions need regular help and support.long-term outcomes of moderate id vary markedly, dependent on the presence and extent of coexisting conditions and disorders that frequently complicate moderate id. most individuals with moderate id are capable of learning daily living activities and can achieve independent self-care, with sufficient teaching and support. complex daily living tasks (eg, money management) need considerable support. most individuals are able to reside in a group home in a community setting with support. the majority of adults with moderate id need sheltered, supported, noncompetitive, vocational positions with minimal communication and conceptual demands, although some are capable of performing unskilled work. few with moderate id are able to marry or raise children.severe id — only 3 to 4 percent of individuals with id are estimated to have severe id. children with severe id gain skills at a rate of approximately one-quarter to one-third of that expected for children without id, and approximately half the pace of children with mild id.individuals with severe id have little understanding of written language or number, time, or money concepts; caretakers provide extensive help in problem solving.individuals with severe id derive benefit from healthy, socially supportive interactions with familiar people who relate at the level of the individual's development. speech development may be delayed until four to five years of age, although some do not develop speech; individuals may use a basic single word or phrase or gesture to communicate direct experience.most individuals with severe id require training in social and self-help daily living skills in high school, and may be trainable in some basic daily living activities, while requiring significant ongoing support and supervision. adults without prohibitive coexisting conditions may be able to participate in sheltered vocational settings and, if not behaviorally disruptive, reside in a group home in the community with appropriate supports. the majority of adults with severe id need substantial assistance with daily living and social skills. in general, severely affected individuals do not marry or raise children [42]. severe id is associated with a reduced lifespan.profound id — approximately 1 to 2 percent of children with id have profound impairment. individuals with profound id may express themselves nonverbally and understand a simple instruction, gesture, or emotional cue. however, outcomes are very variable, and can vary from total dependence to some simple expression and social responsiveness; some individuals learn simple self-care in dressing or feeding.individuals with profound id are usually dependent in all aspects of daily living and have pervasive need of supports. some affected individuals benefit from training in self-help skills, though gains are very slow. individuals may use objects in a goal-directed fashion in self-care or simple recreation. most need high school classes in life skills and comprehensive assistance. individuals with profound id do not learn to read. concurrent sensory and physical limitations are common, and coexisting medical conditions may need additional equipment. medical needs, coexisting conditions, and behavioral characteristics impact placement decisions for individuals with profound id [42].profound id is associated with reduced life expectancy, though the extent depends on the cause, complicating disorders, and the individual's mobility. in one report of 7060 people with profound id, life expectancy was considerably higher among individuals who were mobile (even if unable to walk) and capable of eating with assistance compared with individuals who were immobile and/or dependent on tube feeding (23 versus 4 to 8 years) [44].prevention
cosmetic products such as hair relaxers are ingested commonly, but they appear to be rare causes of esophageal injury [45,46]. in one review of 29 patients with hair relaxer ingestions who underwent upper endoscopy, 6 patients (20 percent) had esophageal mucosal injury and 5 patients (17 percent) had gastric mucosal injury, but these injuries were limited to grade 1 (superficial) injuries [47]. wart or callus removers containing salicylic acid have caused esophageal injury and scarring in case reports; the colloid suspension is viscous, which likely contributes to the injury by prolonging contact with the mucosa [48,49].●

decreased bone mass can occur because peak bone mass is low, bone resorption is excessive after peak bone mass is obtained, or bone formation during remodeling is decreased. all three processes are likely to contribute, in varying degrees, to osteoporosis in individual patients. (see "pathogenesis of osteoporosis".)peak bone mass — in men, bone mineral density (bmd) increases markedly during puberty in response to increasing sex steroid production [17,18]. much of this apparent increase, particularly for cortical bone, is due to an increase in bone size. peak spinal bone density is reached at approximately 20 years [19-21], while the peak density of the radius and femoral shaft is reached somewhat later [20-22].the importance of normal sex steroid production in the acquisition of peak bone mass is illustrated by the findings of low bone mass in young men with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (ihh) [23,24]. because ihh is almost always a congenital abnormality due to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (gnrh) deficiency, this disorder provides a valuable model to assess the effects of hypogonadism on pubertal bone development (ie, the attainment of peak bone mass). both cortical (figure 2) and trabecular bone density (figure 3) are markedly decreased in these men [23,24]. osteoporosis can be detected even before the attainment of skeletal maturity, suggesting that it is due to inadequate pubertal bone accretion rather than postmaturity bone loss. the clinical manifestations and genetics of ihh are reviewed in detail separately. (see "isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency (idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)".)although the observation that peak bmd is reduced in men with congenital hypogonadism illustrates the importance of gonadal steroids in bone development, those findings do not indicate whether androgens, estrogens, or both are primarily responsible for the pubertal increase in bmd and the attainment of peak bone mass. reports that bmd is markedly reduced in men with null mutations in the estrogen receptor-alpha, so that responsiveness to estrogen is essentially absent, or in men with null mutation in the aromatase gene, so that synthesis of estradiol is virtually absent, strongly suggest that estrogens provide the primary hormonal stimulus to the attainment of peak bone mass. (see 'the role of hormones' below.)another important determinant of peak bone density is the timing of puberty. in adult men with history of constitutionally delayed puberty, bmd of the radial shaft, lumbar spine (ls), and proximal femur is significantly lower than in age-matched normal men, and it does not appear to improve with time [25,26]. similar findings have been reported in adolescent boys with delayed puberty [27]. these observations suggest that there is a critical time period during which the skeleton is responsive to sex steroids. (see "approach to the patient with delayed puberty".)other factors that determine peak bone mass are genetic predisposition, chronic illnesses, and medications that negatively impact bone density accrual. (see "pathogenesis of osteoporosis", section on 'peak bone mass acquisition'.)age-related bone loss — after attainment of peak bone mass, men lose approximately 30 percent of their trabecular bone and 20 percent of their cortical bone during their lifetimes. trabecular bone loss appears to start in young adult life, whereas cortical bone loss is either less pronounced or begins later in life [28]. in some studies, the decline in femoral neck density began shortly after attainment of peak bone mass [29,30], and the rate of femoral neck bone loss increased with aging [30,31]. one study reported that bone mineral content of the proximal and distal radius declined at a rate of approximately 1 percent per year after the age of 30 years, whereas another study found that cortical bmd remained stable until later in life [28,32].patterns of change in spine bmd vary depending upon the measurement technique. when measured by quantitative computed tomography (qct), which assesses only vertebral body trabecular bmd, spine bmd declines more rapidly than hip or radius bmd [32,33]. when spine bmd is measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) in the posterior-anterior projection, it often appears to increase in older men [31,34,35], likely due to degenerative changes in the posterior spinous elements (figure 4) [34]. thus, posterior-anterior dxa should be interpreted cautiously when assessing bone density of the spine in older men. (see "overview of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry", section on 'clinical applications of dxa'.)the role of hormones — although gonadal steroids appear to play a crucial role in the attainment of peak bone mass, whether they play a significant role in age-related bone loss is less clear. unlike in women, the rate of age-related gonadal steroid decline is less abrupt in men, and thus, the skeletal impact of these more subtle declines are unclear. however, gonadal levels at the extremes of deficiency have been associated with low bmd and bone loss in older men. numerous epidemiologic studies have reported associations between gonadal steroids and bmd or fractures [36-40]. these associations are weak, however, as might be expected when studying different populations and relating a single hormone measurement to complex endpoints like bone density and fracture.testosterone — some studies have reported significant associations between testosterone, free testosterone, and/or bioavailable testosterone and bmd, rates of bone loss, and prevalent fragility fractures [36-38]. as an example, in the osteoporotic fractures in men study (mros), a cross-sectional and longitudinal study of 2447 men over age 65 years, the prevalence of osteoporosis in the hip or rapid hip bone loss was threefold higher in men whose total testosterone levels were <200 ng/dl (6.9 nmol/l) compared with >200 ng/dl (figure 5) [36].estrogen — in general, associations of bone density with estrogens have been slightly stronger than associations with androgens [39]. in the mros study, the prevalence of osteoporosis in the hip (t-score <-2.5) increased progressively as total or bioavailable estradiol levels fell (figure 5) [36]. in addition, low serum estradiol levels have been associated with an increased risk of future hip fracture in men [40]. fracture risk appears to be even greater in men with low serum estradiol and testosterone concentrations [39,40].estrogen versus testosterone — several studies have evaluated the relative contributions of sex steroids in the regulation of bone resorption and formation (as measured by urinary and serum markers and bmd) in adult men [41-43]. estrogen appears to have the dominant effect on bone resorption and formation.in one physiologic study of induced hypogonadism, 198 healthy men (ages 20 to 50 years) were treated with a gnrh agonist (to temporarily suppress endogenous sex steroid production) and were then randomized to receive 0 (placebo), 1.25, 2.5, 5, or 10 grams of a testosterone gel daily for 16 weeks [43]. a second group of 202 healthy men received the same agents plus anastrozole (to suppress aromatization of testosterone to estradiol).by comparing changes in bone turnover markers, bmd by dxa, and bmd by qct between men who did and did not receive anastrozole, the study demonstrated that increases in bone resorption and decreases in bmd in hypogonadal men were largely due to estrogen deficiency. the risk of developing hypogonadal bone loss appeared to be small until serum estradiol levels fell below 10 pg/ml and/or serum testosterone levels fell below 200 ng/dl.complete androgen insensitivity — subjects with complete androgen insensitivity provide a valuable model to assess whether the sexual dimorphism in peak bone density is genetically or hormonally determined. in these subjects, who are genetic males but phenotypic females, radial shaft density is lower than that of normal men but similar to that of normal women. in contrast, ls density is lower than expected for either men or women of the same age [44-46]. these findings suggest that androgen action contributes to the normal sexual dimorphism in cortical bone density and that the y chromosome, per se, is not sufficient to guarantee the higher cortical density of normal men. insufficient replacement of estradiol after gonadectomy, however, cannot be excluded as a reason for these results. as an example, in one study, noncompliance with estrogen replacement therapy after gonadectomy correlated with lower ls bone density [45]. (see "pathogenesis and clinical features of disorders of androgen action", section on 'complete androgen insensitivity (cais)'.)other hormones — other hormonal changes that may be associated with age-related bone loss include higher serum parathyroid hormone (pth) concentrations and lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin d and insulin-like growth factor-1 (igf-1) concentrations [47-49]. suppression of gonadal steroids in older men with a gnrh agonist increases the skeletal responsiveness to pharmacologic doses of exogenous pth, an observation that might help to explain bone loss in men with hypogonadism [50].risk factors

patients with opgs associated with nf1 tend to have a better prognosis, at least in part due to the predominance of anterior lesions. however, compared with patients without nf1, those with nf1 have approximately twice the recurrence rate following complete excision of an intraorbital glioma, but a similar prognosis following radiation of a chiasmal glioma [8,41,42].even with prolonged survival, however, many patients have significant long-term visual impairment [36,43-45]. in a retrospective study of 59 children with sporadic opgs (median age at diagnosis 2.5 years), 45 percent of patients had 20/40 vision or worse in their best eye at a median follow-up of 5.2 years, including 15 patients (25 percent) with severe bilateral vision loss [36].although the prognosis for survival may be better in nf1 patients with opgs, significant visual impairment is frequent, and it is unclear whether treatment with either chemotherapy or radiation improves the prognosis for retaining vision in these children [45,46].in contrast to children, the clinical course of an opg in an adult resembles the behavior of the tumor's histology, which is more commonly a malignant glioma. in adults, malignant opgs can result in rapidly progressive visual loss, and middle-aged or older adults may present with the rapid onset of blindness [47-50]. tumor invasion into adjacent brain may then become apparent, leading to death within a few months of presentation [51]. standard radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy of these lesions typically leads to disappointing results [52].treatment

if recirculation is due to poor inflow (arterial stenosis or insufficiency), the occlusion will cause a decrease in pressure since the blood pump will demand more blood than is available (since the recirculation route will have been occluded). in this instance, the arterial alarm will sound very quickly, but the venous pressure may change very little.thrombosed fistula — unlike the typical clinical scenario associated with thrombosed arteriovenous (av) grafts, which often clot abruptly, hemodialysis arteriovenous (av) fistulas tolerate much lower blood flow rates without clotting, allowing the lesion longer to progress and become more severe than is typically seen with av graft thrombosis [9]. as a result, an av fistula can develop collateral flow even after the fistula has become completely obstructed. from a clinical perspective, when an av fistula no longer has detectable flow in the dialysis facility, it is generally labeled as a thrombosed av fistula; however, many, if not most of these, contain no thrombus. flow can be so diminished that it is no longer detectable or all the flow (diminished) is going through collaterals. severe stenosis of the av fistula with a proliferation of collateral vessels frequently results in complex anatomy.infected fistula — fistula-associated infections may be either superficial or deep.

sickle cell trait – 1 percentin addition, left renal vein compression between the aorta and proximal superior mesenteric artery, referred to as "nutcracker syndrome," has been suggested as a cause of gross and microscopic hematuria in children that is usually asymptomatic, but may be associated with left flank pain [13,14]. nutcracker syndrome is detected by doppler ultrasonographic assessment of left renal vein diameter and peak velocity or computed tomography (image 1 and image 2) [13,15].the frequency of hematuria due to nutcracker syndrome in children appears to be highest in asia, with the diagnosis rarely entertained in north america. this was illustrated in a japanese case series of 85 children with hematuria without nephritis, nephrolithiasis, or tumor. doppler ultrasonographic findings were consistent with a diagnosis of nutcracker syndrome in 21 of 23 children with gross hematuria and 17 of 52 patients with microscopic hematuria [13]. similar findings were noted in a report from korea of 216 children with isolated microscopic or gross hematuria [14]. doppler ultrasonographic results were consistent with nutcracker syndrome in 33 percent.nutcracker syndrome can also cause orthostatic proteinuria in children. (see "orthostatic (postural) proteinuria", section on 'left renal vein entrapment'.)in children with asymptomatic gross hematuria, we suggest using the following evaluation:●

resistance was more likely in patients with severe kidney disease at presentation (odds ratio [or] 1.28 per 1.13 mg/dl [100 micromol/l] higher serum creatinine). however, although treatment-resistant patients had a higher mean serum creatinine than responders (6.7 versus 4.0 mg/dl [590 versus 353 micromol/l]), therapy was effective in the majority of these patients. remission was induced in 72, 68, and 57 percent of patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) of ≤30, ≤20, and ≤10 ml/min, respectively.●
remove intrauterine gas bubbles (ideally with a continuous outflow system)limiting the distension fluid deficit may also be associated with a decrease in the risk of gas embolism, regardless of the type of fluid or type of electrosurgical instrument. this was illustrated in a randomized trial (n = 50) that found that use of either monopolar and bipolar electrosurgery for operative hysteroscopy resulted in evidence of intracardiac gas bubbles in nearly all patients, although no patients required treatment [26]. a subset analysis found that the likelihood of gas embolism was significantly higher with a fluid deficit of >1000 ml compared with <1000 ml.carbon dioxide must be insufflated with a special instrument known as a hysteroinsufflator. the laparoscopic insufflator delivers 1 l/min or more of flow and should never be used for hysteroscopy, as a gas embolism may occur.hysteroinsufflators can be set to reach a target intrauterine pressure of less than 100 mmhg or to deliver a constant rate of flow of less than 100 ml/min [6,7,29,30].diagnosis and management of gas embolism — dyspnea is the most common symptom; other signs and symptoms are listed in the table (table 2). a fall in a patient's end-tidal carbon dioxide pressure may raise intraoperative suspicion of gas embolism, but may also be present in other conditions [29].if gas embolism is suspected, the procedure should be terminated immediately, the uterus deflated, and sources of fluid or gas removed [29].supportive care (eg, the use of mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, volume resuscitation as indicated) is the cornerstone of management, but active measures may also be helpful. (see "air embolism".)shoulder pain — infrequently, patients will complain of shoulder pain, likely due to diaphragmatic irritation from carbon dioxide. symptoms usually subside in less than 15 minutes, without treatment [31]. the type of distension medium may affect the likelihood of shoulder pain. a systematic review of randomized trials found that shoulder pain was significantly reduced when normal saline was used compared with carbon dioxide (odds ratio 0.2; 95% ci 0.1-0.4) [13].choosing a distending medium

hair tourniquet – in young infants, hair or thread entrapment of digits (picture 1) or genitalia arises from the presence of a loose hair or fiber that wraps around the appendage because of movement of the digit or genitalia in a confined area (eg, feet-in pajamas, socks, mittens, or diaper). discomfort from the hair or thread leads to additional movement, which encourages further entrapment of the appendage over the course of hours or days.in infants, the hair is frequently the mother’s because of increased maternal hair loss during the postpartum period (telogen effluvium). when hair falls unnoticed into the bath water during routine care, it may become attached to the patient’s toe, finger, or genitalia (penis, labia, or clitoris) [2]. hair stretches when wet and can be wound loosely around an appendage but will become constrictive as it dries. hair may also fall into the diaper during changing.in addition, pubic hair tourniquets of the clitoris, labia majora, or labia minora may occur in postpubertal adolescents [3-10], and self-applied hair tourniquets of the genitalia have been reported in prepubertal girls [3,11].●
difficulties in delivery secondary to skin fibrosis and the aggravation of relatively minor symptoms may also occur among pregnant patients with systemic sclerosis (ssc). as an example, the increased abdominal pressure in pregnancy may exacerbate dyspepsia due to esophageal dysmotility. some symptoms, however, may diminish; symptoms of raynaud phenomenon generally lessen because of the vasodilatation of pregnancy [18].society guideline links

fear of pain – many women have a fear of childbirth-associated pain, which can be exacerbated in women with a history of trauma. we discuss the patient's expectations of the discomfort associated with labor, coping strategies, and options for pharmacologic pain management. an antenatal consultation with the obstetric anesthesia team can be helpful if available. (see "preparation for childbirth" and "nonpharmacologic approaches to management of labor pain" and "pharmacologic management of pain during labor and delivery".)intrapartum — the intrapartum experience can be inherently stressful. women with a history of childhood sexual abuse have significant rates of dissociation during childbirth, subsequent difficulty with bonding with the child, and potential long-term consequences to the child's development [43]. as noted above, we encourage women to identify the individuals who will support them through the labor and delivery experience prior to the onset of labor.maneuvers such as fetal scalp electrode placement, cervical assessment, and assisted delivery; complications such as umbilical cord prolapse, postpartum hemorrhage, and perineal lacerations; unplanned cesarean section; and transfer of the baby to the neonatal intensive care unit can all induce extreme stress. whenever possible, we encourage clinicians to explain any examinations or procedures to the patient in advance. during delivery, involuntary micturition or defecation can be humiliating and trigger ptsd symptoms.to help minimize stress, we advise having a consistent and limited number of care providers during labor. ideally, cervical examination is performed by the same provider, who is already known by the patient. we attempt to limit the number of care providers in the delivery room, especially during examination. we also inform the patient of the role of each person. we explain what will be done and the purpose of the exam and ask for her verbal permission. we also review with the patient the need for additional staff in the event of a fetal deceleration or emergency.postpartum — there are limited data on how the postpartum experience may be different for women with a history of trauma with ptsd. a systematic review of 21 studies that examined the relationship between perinatal ptsd and birth outcomes reported contradictory findings regarding an association between ptsd and the mother-infant interaction, mother-infant relationship, or child development [58].it appears that prior depression or depressive symptoms may worsen ptsd symptoms after delivery. in a meta-analysis of 50 studies, risk factors for birth-related ptsd were depression in pregnancy, fear of childbirth, poor health or medical complications during pregnancy, a history of ptsd, and prior counseling for pregnancy- or birth-related issues [59]. a different study that assessed posttraumatic stress symptoms at several time points postpartum reported that use of antidepressant medication in the 10 years prior to birth was associated with higher symptom screening scores six weeks after delivery [60]. as these studies focused on the risk of developing de novo ptsd, more data are needed on the impact of delivery on women with preexisting ptsd.pregnancy loss or termination — the impact of pregnancy loss or abortion on women with prior trauma with ptsd, or similarly severe symptoms, is not known. de novo ptsd can occur in response to spontaneous pregnancy loss, ectopic pregnancy, or pregnancy termination [61-63]. pregnancy termination is not necessarily traumatizing; however, when termination is chosen because of fetal anomalies, it may result in trauma-exposure symptoms. in a questionnaire study of women who terminated a pregnancy because of fetal anomalies, pathological symptoms consistent with ptsd were reported by 46 percent of women at 4 months of follow-up and 21 percent at 16 months [64].medical record documentation

the contemporary, international definition of chronic pancreatitis is "a pathologic fibroinflammatory syndrome of the pancreas in individuals with genetic, environmental, and/or other risk factors who develop persistent pathologic responses to parenchymal injury or stress." the definition includes a description of the common characteristics of chronic pancreatitis, including structural changes that result in pain syndromes, sometimes progressing to irreversible exocrine, and/or endocrine pancreatic insufficiency [1-3]. the structural changes include diffuse or focal destruction, sclerosis, acinar cell loss, fatty replacement, islet cell loss, inflammatory cell infiltrate, and pancreatic duct abnormalities. intraductal obstruction may be caused by protein plugs and/or calculi. extraductal lesions such as trauma, pancreatic or hepatobiliary tumors, or surgical procedures may also lead to chronic inflammatory responses in the pancreas.chronic pancreatitis represents the end stages of a pathologic process that often includes acute pancreatitis or recurrent acute pancreatitis. in most patients, there are multiple factors that together confer susceptibility and drive progressive gland destruction. finally, the clinical features are variable, such that the rate and extent of fibrosis, calcifications, atrophy, pain, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and diabetes mellitus differ markedly among patients.because the pancreas has a large reserve capacity, symptoms of pancreatic failure do not develop until there is a loss of over 90 percent of pancreatic exocrine function [4]. most patients with chronic pancreatitis initially experience recurrent abdominal pain, which may progress to persistent pain. less commonly, patients are asymptomatic or have minimal symptoms until developing signs of advanced disease, such as diabetes mellitus or fat and protein malabsorption. with advances in diagnostic methods, the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis is becoming more common in children. (see "clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic and acute recurrent pancreatitis in children".)this topic review will outline the risk factors for chronic pancreatitis in children, which become contributing etiologic factors once the disease is established. related information is available in the following topic reviews:●

local recurrence due to incomplete removal of the primary tumor is a major unfavorable determinant of prognosis. local recurrence has been reported in 9 to 36 percent of patients, with distant metastasis occurring in 3 to 25 percent [44,64,65]. in a series of 60 patients with sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelids, local recurrence occurred in 18 percent of patients and metastasis in 8 percent [23].in the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (seer) database, the five- and ten-year overall survival rates were 71 and 46 percent, respectively [2]. older age, poorly differentiated tumors, and distant, but not nodal, metastasis are unfavorable prognostic factors [66]. patients with sebaceous carcinoma and muir-torre syndrome (mts) have a worse prognosis. an analysis of seer data on over 3000 patients with sebaceous carcinoma, of whom 64 had mts, found that the five-year, cause-specific survival rates among patients with and without mts were 53 and 78 percent, respectively [29].follow-up

the myelodysplastic syndromes (mds) encompass a series of hematologic conditions characterized by chronic cytopenias (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) accompanied by abnormal cellular maturation. as a result, patients with mds are at risk for symptomatic anemia, infection, and bleeding, as well as progression to acute myeloid leukemia (aml), which is often refractory to standard treatment. (see "therapy-related myeloid neoplasms: acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome".)most patients with mds die because of the consequences of bone marrow failure rather than transformation to aml. thus, use of terms such as "pre-leukemia" or "smoldering leukemia" can be misleading, if taken to imply that death or morbidity from mds results only when aml develops. indeed, the distinction between mds and aml is itself arbitrary, as the world health organization (who) classification describes patients with <20 percent bone marrow blasts as having mds, while those with ≥20 percent blasts are considered to have aml.for many years, transfusion with packed red blood cells and platelets and the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents were the only therapy available. more recently, chemotherapy agents directed at the underlying disorder have been developed and continue to be studied for patients with mds (eg, azacitidine, decitabine, and lenalidomide). however, due to the advanced age of most patients, the chronicity of the disease, and its attendant morbidities, supportive care remains a central component of the management of all patients with mds. patients should be treated as needed with antibiotics for infection and platelet transfusions for bleeding in the setting of thrombocytopenia.this topic will review the major complications of mds and the role of supportive care in its management. the diagnosis of mds, the prognosis of mds, and the treatment of the underlying disorder are presented separately.

inferior migration of the ett may result in unilateral intubation of a mainstem bronchus, putting the patient at risk for barotrauma and pneumothorax as the entire set tidal volume or pressure is delivered to one lung. when this occurs, the right mainstem bronchus is more frequently intubated [18]. (see "diagnosis, management, and prevention of pulmonary barotrauma during invasive mechanical ventilation in adults".)the balloon cuff at the end of the ett may leak or rupture, leading to incomplete delivery of the set tidal volume or pressure and loss of positive end-expiratory pressure (peep). this usually results in an audible air leak and a deflated pilot balloon. similarly, patients can bite through the pilot balloon tube, causing cuff deflation. herniation of the ett cuff over the end of the tube has been reported as a cause of respiratory distress and increased airway pressures [19].large and medium-sized airways — respiratory distress can also be caused by abnormalities in the large and medium sized airways of the tracheobronchial tree.abundant thick airway secretions may become impacted in the lower airways, causing obstruction and atelectasis. the character and volume of secretions prior to the onset of the respiratory distress can help establish this diagnosis. excessive airway secretions can sometimes be detected by examining the flow-volume loop on the ventilator display, where a sawtooth pattern may represent intermittent changes in airway resistance [20]. ensuring adequate humidification of the inspired gases may diminish inspissation of secretions. frequent airway suctioning, pulmonary toilet, and bronchoscopy have also been used to facilitate clearance of secretions [21]. in some cases, unrecognized foreign body aspiration at the time of intubation can result in acute respiratory decompensation. (see "airway foreign bodies in adults".)in addition to underlying lung disease and mechanical obstruction, bronchospasm may cause acute respiratory distress, most commonly in patients with copd, asthma, or volume overload. bronchoscopy, airway suctioning, the use of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, and allergic reactions can also contribute to bronchospasm and respiratory distress [22]. conventional treatment with inhaled bronchodilators is usually sufficient; in severe cases of upper airway edema caused by the endotracheal tube, corticosteroids may be considered. (see "complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients".)bronchospasm may also be complicated by dynamic hyperinflation (also called auto-peep), which will exacerbate patient distress by increasing work of breathing. in addition, auto-peep may cause hypotension and, in severe cases, may present as a cardiopulmonary arrest with pulseless electrical activity. auto-peep usually occurs in the setting of obstructive lung disease, but it may also occur in patients with markedly increased minute ventilatory requirements, for example, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ards). auto-peep may be precipitated by an increase in either airway resistance or minute ventilation or by a reduction in the peak inspiratory flow setting.auto-peep may be appreciated on physical examination and confirmed by review of the flow-time waveforms. auto-peep can be quantified by execution of an expiratory hold maneuver during mechanical ventilation (figure 3). (see "physiologic and pathophysiologic consequences of mechanical ventilation", section on 'auto-peep'.)pulmonary parenchyma and vasculature — atelectasis, pneumonia, aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastroesophageal contents, pulmonary edema, and pulmonary emboli can all cause respiratory distress in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.with the exception of acute pulmonary embolism, these conditions can usually be differentiated by physical examination and plain chest radiography. acute pulmonary embolism is notoriously difficult to diagnose, since there are no specific symptoms, signs, or chest radiograph findings, but it is even more difficult in the mechanically ventilated patient for several reasons. ventilation scans are difficult to perform in mechanically ventilated patients. in addition, interpretation of perfusion scans in the presence of preexisting pulmonary disease, and without the benefit of a ventilation scan, is difficult [23]. ct scans and angiograms are diagnostic but require patient transport, which may be difficult in severely ill patients. although echocardiography can be done emergently at the bedside with a high degree of diagnostic sensitivity in hemodynamically compromised patients, it is not specific. (see "clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism".)problems outside the lung — extrapulmonary processes can cause respiratory distress by restricting inspiration or increasing respiratory drive. thoracic processes that cause restriction include pneumothorax and large pleural effusions. abdominal problems, such as ascites, ileus, or splinting from abdominal pain, may limit chest wall expansion and lower the compliance of the respiratory system [24]. (see "abdominal compartment syndrome in adults".)fever, shock, pain, delirium, and anxiety can increase respiratory drive and cause apparent respiratory distress and agitation without a change in respiratory mechanics or gas exchange. these are diagnoses of exclusion, however, and life-threatening disorders must always be considered before administering sedatives, analgesics, or neuroleptics. the source of the patient's pain or discomfort should be sought and specifically treated [25]. primary measures to prevent and treat delirium (such as minimizing sleep deprivation, reassurance, and providing orientation to time, place, and situation) may be effective.

in another trial, 753 adult patients with a serum potassium of 5.0 to 6.5 meq/l were randomly assigned to receive 1.25, 2.5, 5, or 10 g of zs-9 three times daily for 48 hours; 74 percent had ckd (patients with esrd were excluded), 67 percent were receiving a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor, and most patients had diabetes, heart failure, or both [23]. a normal serum potassium (3.5 to 4.9 meq/l) at 48 hours was attained by 543 patients (72 percent), and these individuals were then reassigned to receive placebo or 1.25, 2.5, 5, or 10 g of zs-9 once daily for two weeks. the serum potassium at two weeks was significantly lower in patients receiving 5 and 10 g doses of zs-9 as compared with placebo (by approximately 0.3 and 0.5 meq/l, respectively) but not with 1.25 and 2.5 g doses. adverse events were similar with placebo and zs-9.in these trials, the steepest decline in serum potassium with zs-9 occurred during the first four hours of therapy [23,73]. this suggests an acute effect on intestinal potassium secretion, rather than simply a reduction in potassium absorption. neither trial evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of zs-9, and neither studied patients with acute hyperkalemia or esrd.do not use sps or other resins — the most widely used cation exchange resin has been sodium polystyrene sulfonate (sps). although "sps" is often used as an abbreviation for sodium polystyrene sulfonate, sps is actually a brand name for sodium polystyrene sulfonate in sorbitol.cation exchange resins do not appear to be more effective in removing potassium from the body than laxative therapy. although uncommon, cation exchange resins can produce severe side effects, particularly intestinal necrosis, which may be fatal. (see 'sps in rare settings' above.)given these concerns, sps or other resins should not be used in patients with chronic mild or moderate hyperkalemia who do not have a hyperkalemic emergency and who do not require a prompt reduction in serum potassium.

mucosal neuromas are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b, which is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait due to a single mutation in the ret proto-oncogene (ret) [9,14]. mucosal neuromas present as diffusely enlarged lips, tongue nodules, and thickened eyelids, either diffusely or nodularly, usually in the first or second decade. pathologically, mucosal neuromas are comprised by markedly enlarged nerve fibers. there is no specific treatment. (see "clinical manifestations and diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2", section on 'men2b'.)ganglion cyst — ganglion cysts are non-neural benign cystic tumors that usually occur in proximity to joints or tendons. they develop from chronic local mechanical irritation in perineural tissue or extend from joints to enter the epineurium [9]. the common peroneal nerve is frequently affected, as are the hands and wrists. a mucous cyst is a ganglion occurring at the distal interphalangeal joint, usually in patients between 40 and 70 years old [9].ganglion cysts are more common in women than men. pain and neurologic deficits of sensation and strength in the territory of the affected nerve are typical presenting manifestations, arising from either intra- or extraneural compression. asymptomatic cysts found on magnetic resonance imaging (mri) are frequent (image 3). surgical removal or aspiration is indicated if symptoms and signs warrant, but intrafascicular dissection and neurolysis in cysts with intraneural involvement may be required [15].intraneural heterotopic ossification — heterotopic ossification of peripheral nerve has been reported rarely and resembles myositis ossificans pathologically with a central fibroblastic core, an intermediate zone of osteoid production, and a peripheral zone of ossification. like myositis ossificans, it is thought to occur secondary to local trauma. pain, paresthesias, and weakness in the distribution of the affected nerve are the presenting complaints [9,16].sarcoid granuloma — sarcoid granulomas can involve cranial and peripheral nerves, which appear firm and thickened. this can be a focal or multifocal process, causing pain, sensory loss, paresthesias, and weakness. the diagnosis may require nerve biopsy. the mainstay of treatment is glucocorticoids, as with systemic sarcoidosis. (see "neurologic sarcoidosis" and "treatment of pulmonary sarcoidosis: disease refractory to glucocorticoid therapy".)inflammatory pseudotumor of nerve — inflammatory pseudotumor of nerve is another rare disorder [9,17]. the swelling is composed of chronic inflammatory (mostly t lymphocytes) and reactive mesenchymal cells, resulting in segmental fusiform or nodular enlargement. the infiltrate is usually limited to the epineurium. sensorimotor deficits in the territory of the affected nerve lead to evaluation, and surgery is usually done because of the deficits and the presumed diagnosis of nerve sheath tumor.leprosy — leprous neuropathy results from infection with mycobacterium leprae and is a common cause of neuropathy in underdeveloped countries. (see "leprosy: epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis", section on 'neuropathy'.)leprosy has a tuberculoid and lepromatous form, dependent on each patient's immune response. tuberculoid leprosy involves cutaneous and subcutaneous nerves, with extensive destruction of nerve fibers secondary to the inflammatory response engendered by the infection [9]. nerves are often enlarged due to the inflammation and from cold abscesses and fibrosis within the nerve. this is less likely in lepromatous leprosy, which results from hematogenous dissemination.the treatment of leprosy is discussed separately.

chronic gout may also cause joint erosions, but these often have an "overhanging edge" suggestive of reparative changes that distinguishes them from erosions due to ra [2]. ultrasound may provide more specific information than conventional radiographs for the diagnosis of gout [19]. dual-energy computed tomography scanning has high specificity for gout but is not available in all clinical settings [20].in addition to the detection of early erosions in ra and uric acid crystal deposition in gout described above, ultrasound may also be useful in the evaluation of the patient with polyarticular pain by detecting subtle synovitis in ra and other causes of inflammatory polyarthritis [21] and calcium pyrophosphate crystals [22] in patients with suspected cppd disease.

transfusion-associated lung injury – transfusion-associated acute lung injury (trali) is an important cause of transfusion-related mortality and should be suspected when dyspnea, bilateral noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, hypotension, and fever occur within six hours of completion of transfusion. it is due primarily to the interaction between leukocytes from the recipient and anti-human leukocyte antigen antibodies or antigranulocyte antibodies from the donor. treatment is supportive. trali is discussed in greater detail separately. (see "transfusion-related acute lung injury (trali)".)circulatory overload — transfusion-associated circulatory overload (taco) may occur in children, although it is more common in adults. manifestations may begin near the end or within six hours of the transfusion. patients should be monitored closely during this time period for suggestive signs and symptoms, including dyspnea, orthopnea, tachycardia, and a wide pulse pressure, often with hypertension. the symptoms of taco are similar to those of trali. distinguishing features are as follows:●

the risk factors for developing apical prolapse are generally the same as for developing anterior or posterior vaginal wall prolapse. (see "pelvic organ prolapse in women: epidemiology, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and management", section on 'risk factors'.)the most common risk factors associated with apical prolapse are vaginal parity (number of vaginal deliveries) and previous hysterectomy [11,12]. the risk of prolapse after hysterectomy was illustrated in a case-control study in which 160,000 women who underwent hysterectomy were significantly more likely than age-matched controls to require subsequent pelvic floor repair (3.2 verus 2.0 percent) [13]. women who have prolapse at the time of hysterectomy have an even higher risk of subsequent surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (pop). a case-control study of women who underwent hysterectomy reported that the risk of subsequent pop repair was 5-fold in those who had a history of vaginal delivery, 8-fold in those who had prior surgery for pop or urinary incontinence, and almost 13-fold in those who had grade 2 or higher prolapse at the time of hysterectomy [14]. surgeons should resuspend the vaginal apex when performing hysterectomy for nonprolapse indications to minimize this risk.candidates for apical prolapse repair

although high-dose captopril therapy was initially associated with a variety of presumed sulfhydryl group-related complications such as rash, neutropenia, taste abnormalities, and even the nephrotic syndrome, these problems have become uncommon since the maximum dose was reduced to 100 to 150 mg/day and particularly since clinicians have begun using other angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors.the side effects that do occur are primarily related directly or indirectly to reduced angiotensin ii formation. these include hypotension, acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, and problems during pregnancy [1]. there are other complications (cough, angioedema, and anaphylactoid reactions) that are thought to be related to increased kinins since ace is also a kininase (see 'cough' below). this is an important distinction clinically because the side effects related to reduced angiotensin ii, but not those related to kinins, are also seen with the angiotensin ii receptor blockers (arbs). (see "renin-angiotensin system inhibition in the treatment of hypertension".)hypotension — weakness, dizziness, or syncope may result from an excessive reduction in blood pressure. in the ongoing telmisartan alone and in combination with ramipril global endpoint trial (ontarget), hypotensive symptoms sufficient to discontinue the drug occurred in 1.7 percent of the 8576 patients who received ramipril [3]. first-dose hypotension, which can be marked in hypovolemic patients with high baseline renin levels, can be minimized by not beginning therapy if the patient is volume depleted and by discontinuing prior diuretic therapy for three to five days. hypotension can also occur after the initiation of therapy in patients with congestive heart failure [4]. the risk can be minimized by beginning with a very low dose, such as 2.5 mg bid of enalapril. (see "treatment of hypertension in patients with heart failure".)reduction in gfr — a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (gfr), which is usually modest but may be severe, is observed in some patients treated with ace inhibitors who have bilateral renal artery stenosis, hypertensive nephrosclerosis, heart failure, polycystic kidney disease, or chronic kidney disease [5,6]. as an example, an elevation in serum creatinine sufficiently severe to warrant discontinuation of the drug occurred in 0.7 percent of the patients who received ramipril in the ontarget trial, which enrolled patients with vascular disease or high-risk diabetes. a doubling of the serum creatinine in this trial occurred in 1.9 percent [3]. (see "renal effects of ace inhibitors in hypertension" and "renal effects of ace inhibitors in heart failure" and "hypertension in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease".)in each of these disorders, intrarenal perfusion pressure may already be reduced, a setting in which gfr is maintained in part by an angiotensin ii-induced increase in resistance at the efferent (postglomerular) arteriole. blocking this response with an ace inhibitor will sequentially relax the efferent arteriole, lower intraglomerular pressure, and reduce the gfr [7]. patients with acute volume loss due to vomiting and/or diarrhea may be particularly susceptible [8].the rise in the serum creatinine concentration generally begins a few days after the institution of therapy since angiotensin ii levels are rapidly reduced. thus, renal function should be checked at three to five days when an ace inhibitor is begun in a patient who has renal artery stenosis or who is at high risk for this problem (as in an older patient with severe hypertension and atherosclerotic vascular disease) [9]. (see "establishing the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension".)even with optimal management, some patients are unable to tolerate the administration of ace inhibitors. termination of the ace inhibitor should be considered if hyperkalemia cannot be controlled (see 'hyperkalemia' below) or the serum creatinine concentration increases more than 30 percent above the baseline value within the first six to eight weeks when blood pressure is reduced. such a decline in renal function is uncommon if the patient is not volume depleted, diuretics have been transiently withheld prior to initiation of therapy, and the patient does not have bilateral renovascular disease. (see "antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults".)another rare cause of acute renal failure that is of unproven relation to ace inhibitors is the development of renal artery thrombosis [10]. this complication appears to occur most often in patients with marked (≥95 percent) stenotic lesions who have an excessive reduction in blood pressure. it is therefore unclear whether there is any specific predisposing effect of the ace inhibitor.hyperkalemia — angiotensin ii and an elevation in the plasma potassium concentration are the major factors that increase the release of aldosterone, which is the major hormonal stimulus to urinary potassium excretion. in addition to the direct effect of systemic angiotensin ii, angiotensin ii generated locally within the adrenal zona glomerulosa may mediate the potassium-induced stimulation of aldosterone [11]. blocking both of these actions with an ace inhibitor will reduce aldosterone secretion, thereby impairing the efficiency of urinary potassium excretion.the overall incidence of hyperkalemia (defined as a serum potassium concentration above 5.5 meq/l) in patients treated with an ace inhibitor or arb is approximately 3.3 percent [3]. however, there is a marked variability in risk. ace inhibitors generally raise the serum potassium concentration by less than 0.5 meq/l in patients with relatively normal renal function. more prominent hyperkalemia may be seen in patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes, concurrent use of a drug promoting potassium retention such as a potassium-sparing diuretic or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or among older adults [12-14].patients with moderately severe to severe heart failure represent a setting in which multiple factors can contribute to the development of hyperkalemia. these include decreased renal perfusion due to the fall in cardiac output and, often, combined therapy with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone or eplerenone) [15]. (see "use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction", section on 'risk of hyperkalemia'.)there is also an increased risk of hyperkalemia among chronic hemodialysis patients who are treated with an ace inhibitor or arb. this was shown in a prospective study of 251 hemodialysis patients in which there was an association between a predialysis serum potassium concentration of ≥5.5 meq/l and the use of an ace inhibitor or arb [16]. use of these agents was associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia (odds ratio of 2.2, 95% ci 1.4-3.4), which was observed in patients with and without residual renal function. dietary measures were the only intervention required to manage the hyperkalemia. anuria appears to be particularly associated with an increased risk [17]. (see "patient education: low-potassium diet (beyond the basics)".)only one study has assessed the effect on potassium levels of angiotensin blockade in peritoneal dialysis patients. in this report of 29 stable normokalemic peritoneal dialysis patients, the risk of hyperkalemia with either an ace inhibitor or an arb was principally observed among those undergoing inadequate dialysis (kt/v less than 2.0) or with low solute transport characteristics [18].there are several mechanisms by which angiotensin ii inhibition can lead to hyperkalemia in patients with end-stage renal disease: decreased urinary potassium excretion in patients with residual renal function; and decreased colonic excretion that accounts for a significant percentage of total potassium loss in such patients [18,19].among hemodialysis patients first receiving an ace inhibitor or an arb, more frequent measurement of the serum potassium concentration should be performed for one month [20]. once stable, monthly measurements are recommended.among patients with chronic kidney disease who are not dialysis dependent, issues surrounding the use of ace inhibitors and hyperkalemia are discussed separately. (see "antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults".)cough — a dry, hacking cough has been described in 5 to 20 percent of patients treated with an ace inhibitor [21]. the best data come from a meta-analysis of 29 trials in which cough was noted in 9.9 percent of patients treated with ace inhibitors [22,23]. in the ontarget trial, cough sufficiently severe to discontinue the drug was observed in 4.2 percent of the patients treated with ramipril [3]. cough is much less common with arbs. (see 'arbs' below.)the cough has the following clinical features:●

levetiracetam – small studies demonstrate that levetiracetam levels decrease by 40 to 62 percent during the second and third trimesters [53-56]. a more detailed analysis of 12 pregnancies demonstrated an even greater change in clearance of levetiracetam from nonpregnant baseline to the third trimester, with an increase of 242 percent [53]. however, the effects on seizure control are less clear from these studies. a prospective study of 18 pregnancies in women on levetiracetam revealed that the increased clearance is maximal in the first trimester, reaching 1.7 times baseline, and that seizure worsening occurs when the individual's serum concentration decreases to 65 percent or less of the non-pregnant baseline concentration [57].many other aeds undergo substantial clearance changes during pregnancy, but data are sparse about the clinical consequences.one group of researchers investigated if the "65 percent rule" determined with lamotrigine held true with other aeds. in other words, when the aed serum concentration fell to less than 65 percent of preconception baseline, did seizures worsen? using a retrospective analysis of clinic patients at a single epilepsy center with 115 pregnancies in 95 women, they reported that significant changes in clearance occurred with lamotrigine and levetiracetam, with average peak clearance increases of 191 and 207 percent, respectively, above nonpregnant baseline [48]. despite increasing doses across most aeds, seizures still increased in 38 percent of women during pregnancy, and seizure deterioration was significantly more likely in patients during the second trimester when the aed concentration fell to <65 percent of preconception baseline. other factors associated with seizure deterioration during pregnancy were the presence of seizures in the 12 months prior to conception and focal seizure types, similar to reports from the eurap study [49]. additionally, the women on levetiracetam monotherapy or aed polytherapy had the highest rates of seizure deterioration.these studies highlight the importance of therapeutic aed monitoring during pregnancy to help prevent seizure deterioration in women on a variety of aeds, and support recommendations by several experts to adjust aed dosing during pregnancy [23,35,58]. gestational-induced pharmacokinetic data are lacking for many of the newer aeds (eg, pregabalin, lacosamide, eslicarbazepine acetate, rufinamide, clobazam), in part because prescriptions in pregnant women are often delayed until some teratogenic safety data are available.changing antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy — with few exceptions, we do not alter aeds during an established pregnancy solely for the purpose of reducing the risk of aed-related fetal malformations. doing so is likely ineffective as a means of structural teratogen avoidance, while potentially risky with regard to seizure occurrence. however, there is evidence that prescribing patterns for women of childbearing age with epilepsy are changing toward aeds with more favorable teratogenic profiles [59,60]. these selections are most often made prior to conception, which underscores the importance of selecting aeds based on the potential for an unplanned as well as planned pregnancy.as heightened vulnerability to any potential teratogen exists primarily in the first nine weeks after the last menstrual period, significant exposure has likely already occurred by the time of missed menstruation (4 to 5 weeks) or presentation to prenatal care (8 to 12 weeks). therefore, it is usually unwise to alter aeds during an established pregnancy purely out of a concern for minimization of teratogenic risk. furthermore, altering an aed regime often involves the synchronous overlapping of medications, with the potential for the interaction of effects associated with the individual agents described above. finally, patients undergoing medication transitions are at increased risk of seizure occurrence [1].there are a few exceptions. if a woman with an unplanned pregnancy is on multiple aeds, and it is felt that seizure control would not be compromised significantly, it may be reasonable to remove one or more aed(s) to lower fetal exposure to aeds with an unfavorable or unknown risk profile. another possible exception would be a woman on valproate whose seizures have not proven to be refractory to other aeds; in such a case, transition off valproate at any point during pregnancy (the sooner the better) may lower the risk for neurodevelopmental delay and autism.screening for malformations — epilepsy does not alter a woman's risk of chromosomal aneuploidy. optional screening for aneuploidy is based on her age at the time of expected delivery (see "prenatal screening for common aneuploidies using cell-free dna").ultrasound screening for morphologic anomalies in the fetus can be definitively undertaken at 17 to 20 weeks gestation (see "ultrasound diagnosis of neural tube defects"). the finding of normal posterior fossa and fetal spine will typically adequately exclude the presence of a neural tube defect. if additional reassurance is desired, measurement of the serum alpha fetoprotein (afp) concentration or amniocentesis for amniotic fluid afp levels should be performed between at or after 16 weeks, especially in women treated with valproate and carbamazepine [61-63]. it is not our practice to recemented fetal echocardiography unless abnormalities are noted on the screening ultrasound. (see "open neural tube defects: risk factors, prenatal screening and diagnosis, and pregnancy management", section on 'alpha-fetoprotein'.)the suspected presence of an anomaly should prompt an immediate referral to a qualified tertiary fetal imaging center. timely diagnosis of morphologic anomaly in the fetus will allow the patient to prepare for the care of an affected child or consider potentially terminating the pregnancy. we acknowledge that these are both highly personal and individualized considerations and should be conducted by qualified maternal-fetal medical and neonatal personnel who can appropriately discuss the risk of continuing a pregnancy and the care needs of the neonate and child.approach to a first seizure in pregnancy
class iii (c), in which chronic inactive lesions with scarring are observed. this is also called focal sclerosing lupus nephritis.additional histologic features include the proportion of glomeruli affected by fibrinoid necrosis and crescents, and the presence or absence of tubulointerstitial or vascular abnormalities.determining prognosis in class iii disease may be clouded by the inability to accurately determine the percent of glomeruli involved. this latter feature is due to the potential for sampling error induced by the relatively small number of glomeruli that are obtained on a typical percutaneous renal biopsy. (see "indications for and complications of renal biopsy".)diffuse lupus nephritis (class iv) — class iv lupus nephritis is the most common histologic pattern and most severe form of lupus nephritis [78]. hematuria and proteinuria are present in virtually all patients with active class iv disease, and the nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, and reduced glomerular filtration rate are all frequently seen. affected patients typically have significant hypocomplementemia (especially c3) and elevated anti-dna levels, especially during active disease [79].class iv lupus nephritis is defined histologically by the following:●

the main strategies that have been used to decrease uremic solute concentration are conventional hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. however, dialysis is nonspecific and also removes essential compounds. in addition, lipophilic compounds, which may be responsible at least in part for functional alterations in uremia, are inadequately removed by current dialysis strategies.with maintenance hemodialysis, treatment with high-flux membranes was suggested to provide superior removal of middle molecules, possibly resulting in improved survival. however, the hemodialysis (hemo) study found no overall survival difference with high- versus low-flux membranes at primary analysis [23]. on the other hand, differences were found for the entire cohort in cardiovascular mortality and in the subgroup treated for >3.7 years upon enrollment for overall mortality with secondary analysis [35]. in the same database, a direct relation between beta2-microglobulin (beta2-m) concentration and mortality was also demonstrated [36]. in addition, the membrane permeability outcome (mpo) trial described above subsequently demonstrated better outcomes associated with high-flux compared with low-flux membranes in the population with serum albumin <4 g/dl [38]. of note, this low serum albumin group composes a large section of the current population on dialysis.adding convection by increasing ultrafiltration and equivoluminous substitution with sterile saline or ultrapure dialysate (hemodiafiltration) adds to middle-molecule removal [154,251-256,306-308]. (see "chronic intermittent high-volume hemodiafiltration", section on 'outcomes'.)a previously ignored component of adequate dialysis is the treatment time. lower morbidity and mortality are observed in patients submitted to long dialysis sessions [309,310]. compounds may be cleared more efficiently with continuous or long-lasting strategies because removal is more gradual (see "technical aspects of nocturnal hemodialysis"). in a strictly comparable setting for all dialysis parameters except treatment length, prolonging high-flux hemodialysis from four to eight hours resulted in a time-dependent increase in beta2-m and phosphorus removal [112]. this implied decreasing blood and dialysis flows in proportion to the increase of dialysis length. however, prolonging hemodialysis did not decrease protein-bound solutes in a similar study [151] unless blood and dialysate flows were kept high [34].optimal removal for each type of molecule may be obtained with a different type of extracorporeal treatment (eg, by using large-pore membranes and/or dialyzers or devices with a high adsorptive capacity for some or several of the uremic toxins). this includes, for example, protein-leaking membranes, which are designed to allow passage of albumin, other similarly sized proteins, and uremic toxins in the 35 to 60 kd size range [311].medium cut-off dialyzers contain larger pores than and remove more middle molecules than high-flux dialyzers, with albumin losses comparable with high-flux hemodiafiltration [312].research centers on alternative measures adding to the removal capacity of classical dialysis. these measures include adsorption [118] or changing the physical conditions within the dialyzer (hemodiafiltration with increased plasma ionic strength) and enhancing the free fraction of protein-bound toxins [313]. clinical tests with the latter strategy yield discrepant results with regard to protein-bound toxin removal [314].removal is also influenced by intestinal intake (especially for the protein-bound solutes) and preservation of renal function [315]:●

an observational study involving 199 patients with five-year follow-up found similar survival with photodynamic therapy compared with esophagectomy (overall mortality 9 versus 8.5 percent) [29]. treatment modality was not a significant predictor of mortality on multivariate analysis.5-aminolevulinic acid — in an initial study using 5-ala, 32 patients with barrett's esophagus and high-grade dysplasia (n = 10) or superficial mucosal cancer (n = 22) underwent photodynamic therapy [13]. patients were maintained on high-dose (20 to 80 mg) omeprazole daily to promote an acid-reduced environment. the mean follow-up period was 10 months (range 1 to 30 months). high-grade dysplasia was eradicated in all patients. tumors less than 2 mm in thickness were also completely ablated. there was no procedure-related morbidity or mortality.5-ala has also been studied in patients with low-grade dysplasia [30]. one such study included 36 patients who were randomly assigned to photodynamic therapy or placebo followed by laser treatment with a diffusing fiber [30]. of the 18 patients given 5-ala, 16 (89 percent) showed macroscopic evidence of barrett's regression while all had complete clearance of dysplasia. the mean reduction in the area of barrett's was 30 percent. of those receiving placebo, two patients (11 percent) had a reduction in the area of barrett's mucosa and one-third no longer had detectable dysplasia.a follow-up report from the same authors included 40 patients with low-grade dysplasia [31]. a macroscopic reduction in the area of columnar epithelium was observed in 35 patients (88 percent) and dysplasia was eradicated in all 40 by one month. the effect was maintained for a median follow-up of 53 months. however, one patient developed a late carcinoma in an untreated area of barrett's three years after treatment.another study compared the efficacy of 5-ala photodynamic therapy with argon plasma coagulation (apc) in 40 patients (32 with no dysplasia and 8 with low-grade dysplasia) who were randomly assigned to one of two 5-ala photodynamic therapy regimens or to apc [32]. after 12 months, histologic evaluation revealed complete ablation in a similar proportion of patients in each group. side effects were more common with photodynamic therapy than with apc. the authors concluded that both techniques can lead to complete reversal of barrett's epithelium in at least two-thirds of patients.the long-term outcome of photodynamic therapy in patients with high-grade dysplasia or early cancer was described in a series that included 66 patients (35 with high-grade dysplasia [group a] and 31 with adenocarcinoma [group b]) who were treated with photodynamic therapy between 1996 and 2002 [33]. a complete response was observed in 97 and 100 percent in the two groups, respectively, at 37 months. one local recurrence was observed in group a and 10 in group b. disease-free survival in patients with high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal cancer was 89 and 68 percent, respectively. seven patients died during follow-up, but none were tumor related. no major complications were observed.buried barrett's

the differential of ph affecting the skin includes dermatoses that fluctuate with the menstrual cycle. in patients with anaphylaxis, the differential includes other triggers of anaphylaxis that occur in association with menses or pregnancy, such as catamenial anaphylaxis or breastfeeding anaphylaxis.nsaid hypersensitivity — nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), which are commonly used in the premenstrual period and the first few days of menses, can cause both urticaria/angioedema or systemic symptoms, including asthma and anaphylaxis [40,55-57]. patients can refrain from use of nsaids in order to determine if symptoms occur in their absence. alternatively, an nsaid challenge could be performed to conclusively diagnose nsaid hypersensitivity. (see "nsaids (including aspirin): allergic and pseudoallergic reactions" and "diagnostic challenge and desensitization protocols for nsaid reactions".)chronic idiopathic urticaria — chronic idiopathic (or spontaneous) urticaria (ciu) is defined as the presence of urticaria with or without angioedema on most days of the week for a period of six weeks or longer. patients with ciu would be expected to have symptoms outside of the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, although symptoms might worsen perimenstrually or with nsaid use.premenstrual exacerbation of a pre-existing dermatosis — patients may have pre-existing atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, acne, psoriasis, or any number of other skin conditions that worsen in temporal relation to menses [58].estrogen hypersensitivity — hypersensitivity to endogenous and exogenous estrogens has also been described and appears to be even rarer than ph [59-63]. estrogen hypersensitivity characteristically presents as a premenstrual flare of urticaria or a delayed-type dermatitis [59]. however, estrogen levels peak earlier in the menstrual cycle (ie, days 6 to 14), compared with progesterone, although there is a secondary rise during the luteal phase that mirrors the rise in progesterone. the diagnosis is supported by a positive immediate or delayed intracutaneous estrogen test [59,60] or an estrogen challenge [61]. treatments for patients reacting to endogenous estrogens are similar to those for ph and include suppression of estrogen with tamoxifen, leuprolide acetate, progestin-only contraceptives, or oophorectomy [59-63].catamenial dermatoses and anaphylaxis — "catamenial" (of or relating to menstruation) dermatoses and anaphylaxis are also temporally associated with the menstrual cycle, but symptoms correlate with the onset of menses, whereas ph correlates with the period of peak progesterone concentrations prior to the onset of menses [31]. however, the term "catamenial anaphylaxis" has been used loosely in the literature and has been applied to premenstrual reactions to progesterone [64,65].progesterone and estrogen both decline significantly prior to the onset of menses (figure 1). it has been proposed that symptoms beginning with the onset of menses are triggered by endometrial release of prostaglandins, which peak on the first day of menses [66,67]. the endometrium synthesizes prostaglandin f2 (pgf2) [68] and has been implicated in mediator release by uterine mast cells [69].in a case report of recurrent anaphylaxis occurring in the first 24 hours of menses, indomethacin, which inhibits prostaglandins, was beneficial. complete resolution of the patient's symptoms occurred following hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy [66].breastfeeding anaphylaxis — there are rare case reports of anaphylaxis associated with breastfeeding [55-57,70]. symptoms most commonly begin in the first few days after delivery and are associated with the act of breastfeeding or the manual expression of breast milk. elevations in serum tryptase have been documented [57]. the pathophysiology of lactation-associated anaphylaxis is not well-understood, but one theory is that a rapid decrease in progesterone leads to an exaggerated histamine response [57]. hypersensitivity to prolactin and oxytocin has also been explored, but skin testing to these hormones was negative [56,57]. in some patients, the symptoms resolve after several days of breastfeeding, although they may occur with subsequent pregnancies [56,70].

antimuscarinic eye drops – several randomized trials have demonstrated topical antimuscarinic agents (eg, atropine, pirenzepine) are effective in slowing the progression of myopia in children [10-15]. this treatment is widely used in asia; however, it is less commonly prescribed in the united states. in a randomized trial of 400 children with myopia, low-dose atropine (0.01% ophthalmic solution) was more effective in slowing the progression of myopia and resulted in fewer visual side effects than higher doses of atropine [15].●

the major risk factor for hyponatremia following transurethral resection, hysteroscopy, or other percutaneous procedures is the volume of irrigant absorbed. absorption of 1000 ml of glycine irrigation fluid in women undergoing hysteroscopy is associated with a reduction in serum sodium of approximately 10 meq/l (figure 1), while 3000 ml reduces the serum sodium by approximately 30 meq/l [11-13].men undergoing tur of the prostate show smaller reductions of 6 to 8 meq/l after absorbing 1000 ml and 20 meq/l after absorbing 3000 ml [13-15]. these gender differences are probably due mostly to higher lean body weight and total body water in men. thus, men must absorb more fluid than women to produce the same dilutional reduction in serum sodium (see 'halt procedure at absorption thresholds' below).procedural risk factors for excess fluid absorption and hyponatremia during endoscopic procedures include the type of procedure (operative versus diagnostic), introduction of fluid at high pressure, visceral perforation, prolonged operative time, and type of anesthesia [16].operative procedures are associated with a higher risk of excess fluid absorption than diagnostic procedures. when tissue is resected, veins may be severed (eg, large prostatic veins) or uterine venous sinuses may be exposed [13,16]. irrigation fluid can then be directly and rapidly absorbed into the vascular system. in hysteroscopy, for example, the risk of excess fluid absorption is particularly high during resection of fibroids. the risk is much lower with diagnostic procedures since monopolar electrosurgery is not performed and nonconductive (ie, non-electrolyte) fluids are not required.fluid absorption into the vascular space begins when the fluid pressure exceeds the venous pressure (about 10 mmhg) [16] (see 'minimize fluid pressure' below).in addition to fluid absorption directly into the vascular space (intravasation), perforation of a viscus during surgery can result in rapid extravasation of irrigation fluid into the surrounding space. with perforation of the bladder or uterine wall, fluid will extravasate into the peritoneal cavity or retroperitoneum. with perforation of the prostatic capsule during transurethral resection (tur), fluid extravasates into the periprostatic space [13,16-18]. fluid can also traverse the fallopian tubes during hysteroscopy; however, a history of prior tubal ligation does not seem to affect the volume of fluid absorbed [16,19]. the fall in serum sodium occurs more slowly following extravasation compared to intravasation (see 'time course of hyponatremia' below).prolonged operative time permits greater opportunity for fluid absorption [20-22]. however, the available data are not sufficient to define an operative time threshold beyond which excessive fluid absorption is likely to occur. for tur of the prostate, fluid absorption is greater during the second half of the procedure, regardless of operating time [22] (see 'monitor fluid absorbed' below).the type of anesthesia may influence fluid absorption in women undergoing endometrial resection, although the available data are conflicting. in a randomized trial of 24 women undergoing hysteroscopy, fluid absorption was significantly higher with epidural compared to general anesthesia (648 versus 381 ml) [23]. by contrast, a subsequent retrospective cohort study found that fluid absorption was highest with general anesthesia, less with epidural anesthesia, and lowest with local anesthesia and intravenous sedation [24].the administration of intracervical vasopressin to reduce bleeding during hysteroscopy appears to protect against the development of hyponatremia by reducing local absorption of the irrigation fluid. in a randomized trial of 33 women undergoing hysteroscopic endometrial ablation, intracervical administration of vasopressin during hysteroscopy was associated with a significantly lower plasma glycine concentration at 20 minutes (8.8 versus 16 mmol/l) and a nonsignificantly smaller reduction in plasma sodium from baseline (2.2 versus 6.8 meq/l at 40 minutes) [25]. possible protection against hyponatremia was also noted in an observational study of intraprostatic administration of vasopressin in men undergoing tur of the prostate [26]. in contrast to the possible benefits of intracervical or intraprostatic vasopressin, the systemic effects of vasopressin would be expected to exacerbate any reduction in serum sodium by limiting water excretion.there are limited data regarding patient-specific risk factors for excess fluid absorption and hyponatremia following tur of the prostate or bladder or hysteroscopy. for men undergoing tur of the prostate, smoking was associated with fluid absorption exceeding 1000 ml in a retrospective study [27]. the physiologic basis of such an effect, if real, might be that the blood supply to the prostate increases due to the variable degree of hypoxemia that accompanies smoking.pathogenesis of hyponatremiavolume and rate of fluid absorption — the likelihood of developing hyponatremia and associated symptoms and complications (eg, nausea, cerebral edema) following transurethral resection (tur) of the prostate or bladder or hysteroscopy is related to the rate, volume of absorption, osmolality, and volume of distribution of the nonconductive (ie, non-electrolyte) irrigation solution, and the rapidity of metabolism and/or excretion of the solute and the water load [11,12,16,28-33]. there is a direct correlation between the glycine deficit (the difference between the infused and collected volumes of the glycine irrigant) and the fall in serum sodium (figure 1). (see 'clinical manifestations' below.)the relationship between the glycine deficit and the reduction in serum sodium and the development of nausea and cerebral edema on computed tomography was illustrated in a study of 20 women [12]:●

in 2001, an american heart association (aha) science advisory reached the following conclusion [91]: "moderate intake of alcoholic beverages (one to two drinks per day) is associated with a reduced risk of chd in populations… despite the biologic plausibility and observational data in this regard, it should be kept in mind that these are insufficient to prove causality… without a large-scale, randomized, clinical end point trial of wine intake, there is little current justification to recommend alcohol (or wine specifically) as a cardioprotective strategy."●

fatigue (asthenia, weakness) is the most common symptom in palliative care; it is also one of the most underdiagnosed and undertreated. untreated or undertreated fatigue significantly affects the quality of life of patients receiving palliative care, and appropriate assessment and management of fatigue is essential. (see "palliative care: overview of fatigue, weakness, and asthenia".)fatigue is typically a multidimensional symptom, often with multiple contributing causes. the major contributors to fatigue in patients with advanced cancer are outlined in the table (table 4).anemia is a particularly important contributor in patients undergoing cancer treatment. however, the importance of anemia is diminished towards the end of life for cancer patients and for others with nonmalignant serious and/or life threatening illnesses, in whom other contributing factors, such as psychological symptoms, including anxiety and depression, as well as pain, cachexia, side effects of medications, physical inactivity, and infection, may play a greater role. (see "palliative care: overview of fatigue, weakness, and asthenia", section on 'causes and pathophysiology' and "cancer-related fatigue: prevalence, screening, and clinical assessment", section on 'main contributory factors'.)the assessment of fatigue in palliative care patients can be complex given its subjective and multidimensional nature. as such, there is a trend towards multidimensional assessment (ie, asking about different aspects of fatigue, such as muscular weakness or tiredness associated with a sleep disturbance) rather than asking a single question, “are you tired?” (see "approach to symptom assessment in palliative care", section on 'fatigue'.)a comprehensive history and physical examination is indicated to identify potentially reversible etiologies. review of all medications, including prescriptions, over the counter medications, and alternative/complementary therapies, is particularly important to identify side effects and potential drug-drug interactions that may be contributing to fatigue. simply altering the dose or dosing interval may substantially improve fatigue. management of fatigue includes aggressive treatment of reversible causes, if any are identified (table 5). if a specific cause cannot be identified, symptomatic management is appropriate. all patients should be counseled as to coping strategies that conserve energy (table 6 and table 7).in the setting of palliative care, there are limited data to support one pharmacologic approach to fatigue over any other [27]. for patients in the terminal phase of illness who have a high symptom burden that includes fatigue, a two-week trial of a glucocorticoid (eg, prednisone 20 to 40 mg or dexamethasone 4 to 8 mg every morning) is reasonable [28]. the role of psychostimulants is not well defined, particularly for patients with serious and/or life-threatening illnesses other than cancer. however, a trial of methylphenidate (eg, starting with 5 mg every morning and increasing, as needed, to 5 mg in the morning and at noon, 10 mg in the morning and 5 mg at noon, then 10 mg in the morning and at noon) or modafinil is reasonable for fatigued patients when opioid-related sedation is a contributing factor. overall, studies have found that psychostimulants provide no significant improvement in cancer-related fatigue compared with placebo. ginseng may have the potential to improve cancer-related fatigue, although a trial did not demonstrate benefit over placebo [29]. (see "palliative care: overview of fatigue, weakness, and asthenia", section on 'pharmacologic approaches' and "cancer-related fatigue: treatment", section on 'interventions'.)nonpharmacologic approaches that may be helpful include moderate exercise, yoga, and cognitive-behavioral therapy.

during treatment of acute hypernatremia, repeated laboratory measurements are necessary every one to two hours to ensure that serum sodium concentration is falling at the desired rate, to avoid overshooting the desired endpoint, and to observe for hyperglycemia. during treatment of chronic hypernatremia, the serum sodium should be monitored every four to six hours after the fluid repletion regimen is initiated. if the repeat serum sodium indicates that the target rate of correction has been attained, then the frequency of measurement can be reduced in most patients to every 12 to 24 hours. however, in patients who have large, ongoing water losses due, for example, to hyperglycemia and glycosuria or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, the serum sodium should be measured approximately every four hours during the first day of therapy to ensure that the fluid repletion regimen is adequate. the fluid repletion regimen should be modified, if necessary, based upon the sequential measurements of serum sodium.

in the late menopausal transition, cycle variability increases. in addition, fluctuations in serum concentrations of fsh and estradiol may be quite striking; high fsh and low estradiol values may be suggestive of menopause, but soon thereafter fsh and estradiol may return to the normal premenopausal range (figure 6) [50].the clinical manifestations and endocrinology of the menopausal transition are reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (see "clinical manifestations and diagnosis of menopause", section on 'menstrual cycle and endocrine changes'.)in addition to the decline in follicular number, there may be a decrease in hypothalamic-pituitary sensitivity to estrogen during perimenopause. this was illustrated in a study of 160 perimenopausal women with anovulatory menstrual cycles who collected daily urine samples (across one cycle) for gonadotropin and sex steroid levels [51]. some cycles were characterized by normal preovulatory levels of estrogen, but no luteinizing hormone (lh) surge, suggesting a failure of estrogen-positive feedback, while in others, normal follicular phase estrogen levels did not suppress lh secretion, indicating a failure of estrogen-negative feedback.epidemiology — the average age of menopause, defined as permanent cessation of menses, is age 51 years in normal women. [52]. clinical menopause is recognized after 12 months of amenorrhea. there is considerable variability around the onset of menopause with 5 percent of women undergoing menopause after age 55 and another 5 percent between ages 40 and 45 years [53,54]. menopause before age 40 years is considered abnormal and is referred to as primary ovarian insufficiency (formerly called premature ovarian failure). (see "pathogenesis and causes of spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure)".)factors affecting age at menopause — a number of factors are thought to play a role in determining an individual woman's age of menopause, including genetics, ethnicity, smoking, and reproductive history.genetics — women with a family history of early menopause are at higher risk for undergoing an earlier than average menopause themselves [55]. additional evidence that genetic factors play a role in the normal variation in age at natural menopause include the following:●

(see "renin-angiotensin system inhibition in the treatment of hypertension", section on 'direct renin inhibitors'.)drugs with little or no effect — other antihypertensive drugs have little or no effect on protein excretion [20,22,23]. as an example, beta blockers, diuretics, and the alpha-1-blockers (such as prazosin) typically have a lesser antiproteinuric effect than ras inhibitors [20,22,23]. in a 1995 meta-analysis, ace inhibitors lowered protein excretion by 40 percent compared with 16 percent for beta blockers and 14 percent for other, non-calcium channel blocker antihypertensive drugs [20]. sympathetic blockers, such as methyldopa and guanfacine, had little effect on protein excretion.importance of salt intake — in patients with ckd, a high sodium intake (above approximately 6 g/day [14 g of sodium chloride]) is associated with a higher risk of having a cardiovascular event, including heart failure, myocardial infarction, and stroke [43]. the effect of sodium reduction on cardiovascular disease is presented in detail separately. (see "salt intake, salt restriction, and primary (essential) hypertension".)in addition, in patients with proteinuric ckd, the antiproteinuric effect of ras inhibitors and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers is greatly impaired with a high salt intake, even when blood pressure control seems appropriate, and is enhanced with salt restriction [21,44-51]. the benefits of ras inhibitors on prevention of end-stage renal disease (esrd) in patients with proteinuric ckd may also be enhanced by a low-salt diet and/or mitigated by a high-salt diet [49-51]. similar findings are seen in diabetic nephropathy. (see "treatment of diabetic kidney disease", section on 'salt intake and proteinuria'.)the following examples illustrate the range of findings:●

cover the blister pad with paper and elastic tape as described for large blisters above or, for large heel blisters, make a heel cup out of elastic tape (figure 2).with proper treatment of blisters, children and adolescents should be able to participate in activities without restriction. dressing should be soaked off and the blisters inspected daily until healing has occurred followed by reapplication. the caregivers should be advised to watch for signs of infection, including redness, increased pain, swelling, and pus drainage and to seek prompt medical attention if they occur.plantar puncture wound — plantar puncture wounds involving the heel are a common injury. typical objects causing these injuries include nails, pins, other metal objects, wood, stones, and glass. these wounds have a significant risk for infection. when evaluating plantar puncture wounds in children and adolescents the clinician should determine when the injury occurred, whether the patient was barefoot or wearing shoes, and what object caused the wound, if known. the wound should be examined with the patient prone to be able to assess it completely. (see "infectious complications of puncture wounds", section on 'epidemiology' and "infectious complications of puncture wounds", section on 'diagnosis'.)imaging is warranted when there is a clinical suspicion of a retained foreign body. plain radiographs can detect many radiopaque foreign bodies (eg, glass, stones, or metallic objects). wood, plastic, and other radiolucent objects can be located with ultrasound. computed tomography (ct) and magnetic resonance imaging (mri) are also helpful methods of localizing a retained foreign body when plain radiographs or ultrasound fail. mri cannot be used when metallic objects are present. (see "infectious complications of puncture wounds", section on 'diagnosis'.)the management of plantar puncture wounds depends upon the presence of infection and is discussed separately. (see "infectious complications of puncture wounds", section on 'prevention' and "infectious complications of puncture wounds", section on 'management'.)laceration — plantar lacerations of the heel warrant assessment, debridement, and treatment according to the general principles of wound management. typically, nonabsorbable sutures are used for wound closure and are kept in place for approximately 10 days. (see "minor wound preparation and irrigation" and "closure of minor skin wounds with sutures".)lacerations to the sole of the foot frequently involve cuts caused by sharp objects that the patient steps on while barefoot and foreign bodies are an important consideration. imaging is warranted when there is a clinical suspicion of a retained foreign body. plain radiographs can detect many radiopaque foreign bodies (eg, glass, stones, or metallic objects). wood, plastic, and other radiolucent objects can be located with ultrasound. ct and mri are also helpful methods of localizing a retained foreign body when plain radiographs or ultrasound fail. mri cannot be used when metallic objects are present. (see "infectious complications of puncture wounds", section on 'diagnosis'.)relative to wounds on other parts of the body, lacerations on the heel are more painful to anesthetize by local injection. a posterior tibial nerve block provides an alternative approach that may provide better pain control during the procedure. (see "lower extremity nerve blocks: techniques", section on 'ankle block'.)lower extremity wounds are more prone to infection than lacerations with better perfusion (eg, face or scalp lacerations). thus, patients should have a wound check within a few days of wound closure and should be given careful instructions regarding proper wound care, including no swimming, no immersion while bathing, and monitoring for infection. (see "closure of minor skin wounds with sutures", section on 'aftercare'.)contusion — contusion of the heel, sometimes referred to as a heel pad or foot pad contusion, can be caused by acute trauma (eg, landing from high fall) or stepping on a root or rock during hiking or trail running. examination reveals focal soft tissue tenderness at the plantar surface of the mid portion of the heel (not at the insertion of plantar fascia, which suggests plantar fasciitis). this is where the os calcis is most prominent and thus, at higher risk of contusion.the management of heel contusions is discussed in more detail separately. (see "evaluation and diagnosis of common causes of hindfoot pain in adults", section on 'heel contusion'.)calcaneal fracture — clinical presentation of a calcaneal fracture depends upon its location and the severity of the injury. most calcaneus fractures result from significant trauma, typically an axial loading of the foot following a fall or jump from a height. pain is usually quite severe and weightbearing is often impossible. swelling and tenderness are typically evident, and may be severe. deformity of the heel may be apparent. the physical examination should include vital signs and a careful evaluation looking for signs of internal injury, particularly for patients involved in high energy trauma (eg, fall from height). typically, patients with a calcaneus fracture from high energy trauma manifest tenderness around the heel and hindfoot. areas to palpate include the tuberosity, body, and anterior portions of the calcaneus. (see "calcaneus fractures", section on 'mechanism and clinical presentation'.)calcaneal fractures are diagnosed on the basis of imaging studies. radiographic evaluation of a suspected calcaneus fracture begins with plain radiographs, including lateral and axial views (image 1 and image 2 and figure 3). additional views and ct are obtained when clinicians require greater detail about the extent of the fracture or when there is concern for an occult fracture despite nondefinitive initial radiographs. in addition, half of the patients with a calcaneus fracture sustained during a fall or other high-energy trauma have concomitant injuries, including fracture of the contralateral calcaneus and compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine (image 3a-b), and areas of concern based upon the clinical evaluation should be imaged [7,8]. (see "initial management of trauma in adults".)the diagnosis and management of acute calcaneus fractures are discussed in greater detail separately. (see "calcaneus fractures", section on 'diagnosis' and "calcaneus fractures", section on 'extraarticular fracture types' and "calcaneus fractures", section on 'intraarticular fracture types'.)achilles tendon rupture — achilles tendon rupture occurs rarely in children or young adolescents. case reports have described direct trauma to the posterior heel that directly or indirectly disrupts the tendon [9,10]. with rupture, patients often report severe pain at the back of the ankle and have difficulty bearing weight. some also describe a "pop". however, the absence of pain does not rule out rupture. physical examination may show a gap in the tendon contour compared to the unaffected side and a proximal nodule in the calf. the calf squeeze or thompson test (picture 1) demonstrates no plantar flexion when the gastrocnemius muscle is squeezed. (see "achilles tendinopathy and tendon rupture", section on 'tendon rupture' and "achilles tendinopathy and tendon rupture", section on 'physical examination'.)the treatment of achilles tendon rupture is discussed separately.
